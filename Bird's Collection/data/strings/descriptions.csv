bc_antiquedestroyer,SHIP,"One of the very rare, working antique hulls found throughout the Sector, the Verisimilitude is an elegant fast destroyer with moderate armament. Not so elegant are the two massive engine nacelles which, although unwieldy, can grant the ship massive bursts of speed. This allows the destroyer to take out much larger targets, provided they can’t turn to bear their firepower upon it. However, these advantages come at a cost: the engines guzzle fuel, and the antique components are difficult to maintain in the current state of the Sector.",,,,
bc_antiquecruiser,SHIP,"A bizarre ship, this hulking ship is one of the largest phase ships seen in the Sector. This hull, unlike other phase ships, is very slow, relying on its phase spool to catch targets, and packs a punch, possessing more weapons than many other phase ships. Rather than using its phase cloak to maneuver and dodge attacks, this ship utilizes it to brawl, ducking into p-space to recharge its weapons and take a breather before plunging back into the fray to unleash devastating volleys of fire.",,,,
bc_antiquefrigate,SHIP,"A highly specialized antique design, this ship, along with its sister, the Lacustrine, are armed with the powerful Dedicant Autocannon. This ship in particular is armed with no other weapon, and although capable of high damage, it relies on other ships to defend it and open up areas for assault due to the lack of point-defense.",,,,
bc_antiquefrigate_alt,SHIP,"The sister ship of the Limerence, this antique cannon frigate sacrifices one of its Dedicant Autocannons to increase defensive and flight capabilities. The removed cannon also reduces mass, increasing the ship's mobility and speed.",,,,
bc_antiqueshuttle,SHIP,"Historians theorize that the Kenosis was once a civilian vessel, used for ferrying citizens in and out of atmosphere. However, at some point long before the Collapse, it was fitted with a missile armament to grant the ship offensive capabilities. With high mobility and appreciable weapons, this ship serves well as a ship to finish off overloaded ships or chase down fleeing enemies.",,,,
bc_antiquecarrier,SHIP,"The Kenodoxy was once a hauler ship, long before the Collapse when elegant designs were commonplace. But there was conflict, even before the Sector was plunged into chaos, and this ship was converted into a carrier. While it may seem like a ramshackle conversion, closer inspection reveals skilled engineering to bring this once-civilian ship up to combat standards, and high quality parts to allow for speedy fighter replacement.",,,,
bc_racingeagle,SHIP,"A rare Eagle variant, this ship sacrifices some firepower and hull for vastly increased mobility. First created for racing, the sport’s popularity has fallen after the Collapse and these hulls are now used for military operations.",,,,
bc_raschel,SHIP,"An ancient design theorized to be built just after the Onslaught, this heavy frigate has a heavy arsenal that it uses to punch above its weight. However, the old flux core design struggles to keep up with both the inefficient shield and overbuilt weapons systems.",,,,
bc_ranine,SHIP,"A small frigate with heavy firepower—but not much else. Armed with two medium mounts, this ship can contribute to a firefight but can’t take much fire itself due to the lack of point defense.",,,,
bc_salvager,SHIP,"A small, durable little salvaging ship that has been servicing the Sector for centuries, the Calix is a dependable little ship for exploration, or simply to accompany combat fleets to ensure battle salvage is recovered.",,,,
bc_piratedram,SHIP,"A Dram that has been (very) modified to host a large mount. The ship retains a civilian-grade flux grid and hull, only sporting improved armor.",,,,
bc_heavycruiser,SHIP,"An alternative take on the Dominator, the Malefactor increases its predecessor’s frontal armament, sacrificing missile mounts and defense to strike hard with a trio of large hardpoints. It also sports a nigh-impenetrable armor belt, making up for its weak point defense. This sounds good on paper, but the Malefactor’s miserable speed and maneuverability make it an easy target for mobile ships, and its shields are more of a suggestion than an actual defense. Due to this, the ship never achieved the universal status of the Dominator, although is still feared by any who can’t outmaneuver it.",,,,
bc_skeleton,SHIP,"An absolutely psychopathic design, this ‘ship’ is theorized to have originally resembled a frigate. Somehow, only blueprints of the gutted variant survived the Collapse, and the result is… this. Only the most well-paid — or suicidal — crew will pile into this death trap, as its reputation is anything but positive. Typically used by uncaring admirals to capture strategic points quickly without regard for the unlucky crew assigned to the ship.",,,,
bc_oldtransport,SHIP,"An ancient ship, this model has been lovingly restored to near-full capabilities. The Vardingale is the most common of this design family, and sees use by independent traders who need a tough, dependable, and fast ship to deliver goods without being caught by pirates — or trading authorities.",,,,
bc_oldfrigate,SHIP,"This ship has been around for generations, and the work of sentimental crew can be seen throughout the worn corridors. The Vamplate is a destroyer best used for escort duties, as its armament is light. However, its PD drones can be a potent tool to defend vulnerable ships from swarms of missiles.",,,,
bc_olddestroyer,SHIP,"A hardy destroyer, this ship has been serving the Sector for dozens—maybe hundreds—of years. Utilizing its shield drones and good armaments, this destroyer can take a beating, and can dish one out too. Ideal for distracting cruisers or capital ships by drawing fire, this ship can open up lanes for attacks or flanks to take out larger targets.",,,,
bc_oldcruiser,SHIP,"A unique cruiser that has been flying for years on end, this cruiser utilizes dual missile drones to strike targets that have been overloaded by its considerable main armament. Ideal at countering slow ships that can’t dodge the slow missiles fired by its drones, this cruiser is a good addition to any fleet lacking missiles.",,,,
bc_egg,SHIP,"A small ship designed purely for escort duties, this egg-shaped craft sports a built-in Paladin system and active flares. Praised by both its own crew and crews of other ships for its capability to save ships with a remarkable degree of success.",,,,
bc_combatfreighter,SHIP,"Essentially an oversized Cerberus, this ship is for captains who want more combat capabilities and more cargo than its smaller cousin. Favored by economic traders who don’t want to spend their hard-earned credits on dedicated escorts.",,,,
bc_galliard,SHIP,"A design that many consider the epitome of the Low Tech doctrine, this heavy destroyer has both oversized guns and oversized engines while still sporting decent armor. However, these systems make mounting a shield generator impractical, and so the ship instead uses side-mounted flak canisters to protect itself from missile strikes. Ideal for chasing down frigates or support ships, it struggles against any ship that outranges it or possesses armaments heavy enough to break through its armor.",,,,
bc_hightech_carrier,SHIP,"A light carrier that sacrifices nearly all offensive armament in exchange for high speed. Used to quickly deliver fighter forces to areas needing support, this ship should be kept out of the front lines as it is very fragile.",,,,
bc_midlinefrigate,SHIP,"A frigate with a uniquely wide frame, this ship is nimble, allowing it to strike unwary targets before retreating to avoid enemy fire. However, it is quite fragile and will quickly crumble if its shields are downed.",,,,
bc_salvagefrigate,SHIP,"Designed to fill the role of the Shepherd in a more combat-oriented fashion, this frigate is capable of defending itself should a fight occur. However, it is not as versatile as the Shepherd and lacks the mining drones the other ship utilizes to support allies.",,,,
bc_escapade,SHIP,"A Venture derivative, this carrier sacrifices much of its logistic capability to field three wings of fighters. However, it still sports a surveying suite and can aid explorers in charting systems and protecting their fleets from the threats found beyond the Core Worlds.",,,,
bc_gallize,SHIP,"A heavy frigate, the Gallize is designed to bolster line formations with good firepower and its Argil-class drones, which can help to support larger ships. While the ship itself is a basic all-rounder design, it has a high degree of versatility and can be employed in a variety of roles.",,,,
bc_hightech_destroyer,SHIP,"An advanced ship, the nimble Retral-class is lightly armed for a destroyer. However, this firepower can be boosted significantly using the High Energy Focus system, allowing for bursts of destructive power. While some may look at the Retral’s shield and scoff at its frontally-locked position and poor arc, the shield has high efficiency to absorb attacks.",,,,
bc_lowtech_carrier,SHIP,"A unique carrier thought to be the inspiration for Altair Exotech’s Heron, this ship is fast for a ship of its age, and boasts a remote damper system allowing for massively increased fighter survival rate. With good armor and a monstrous point-defense network, this ship is survivable enough to field fighters in prolonged battles.",,,,
bc_combattanker,SHIP,"A unique fuel tanker, the Nihilo-class has decent capacity while carrying a respectable missile armament. Often used by scavengers or frontier traders for its increased firepower, the Nihilo is not to be underestimated.",,,,
bc_pirate_brawler,SHIP,"A Kite-class aeroshuttle secreted away to some dark shipyard, this formerly civilian craft has been ripped apart and upgraded with a formidable amount of weapons. Often referred to as an inferior imitation of the Brawler-class gunship, the Kite Mk. II is a prime example of pirate hubris (or ingenuity?).",,,,
bc_lowtech_battlecarrier,SHIP,"A capital ship dating to a transitionary period in Domain Navy doctrine, the Admonition is a fast, moderately armed battlecarrier used to support the venerable Onslaught and Legion commonly used by the Hegemony. Unique for a ship of its age, the Admonition has high speed and only medium armor, making it unpopular among traditional admirals who view its qualities as eccentric. Utilizing its built-in flak batteries, the Admonition is able to stop enemy missile strikes and suppress weaker ships.",,,,
bc_dronedestroyer,SHIP,"A unique civilian destroyer with appreciable exploration capability, the Rabbit is an efficient surveyor to bolster any roving scavenger. Well armed for a civilian vessel, the Rabbit struggles to bring its three turrets to bear due to mediocre speed and poor weapon arcs. The ship is also equipped with a surveying drone, which is considerably armed and is used to defend the ship in combat.",,,,
bc_scrapcarrier,SHIP,"A hulking mass of prefabricated parts and jury-rigged hangar bays, the Churl is a makeshift vessel that has poor speed, armor, and shields. However, it can field an impressive amount of strike craft using large arrays of microforges, allowing it to effectively support any fleet that can manage to defend this ponderous beast.",,,,
bc_biglasher,SHIP,"Truly a bizarre vessel, the Crasher appears to simply be a Lasher-class frigate scaled up to almost three times the size. Like its smaller sibling, the Crasher is a dependable ship able to punish enemies with its array of ballistic mounts and the Accelerated Ammo Feeder system. However, the ship is more costly to maintain than other tried-and-true alternatives like the Eagle and Dominator.",,,,
bc_midline_cruiser,SHIP,"Created by Altair Exotech to fill a more specialized niche than the dependable Eagle and Champion, the Chant is an odd cruiser utilizing a large ballistic broadside and respectable mobility to batter down opponents. While its shield is narrow, it has higher efficiency than other vessels of its era, allowing it to take hits while its heavy battery fires.",,,,
bc_lowtech_cruiser,SHIP,"Aggression, speed, and armor are the three elements the Hystricine prioritizes over all else. With a massive engine array, strong armaments and a Bludgeon Drive, this ship accomplishes this with flying colors. Using its Bludgeon Drive to ram enemies and catch unwary foes, the Hystricine is a monstrous cruiser utilized in Luddic fleets for its rugged nature and speed.",,,,
bc_lowtech_crusier_lp,SHIP,"Somehow, this impressive warship found its way into the hands of the radical Luddic Path. Outfitted with an array of Hammer-class torpedoes, the already terrifying cruiser now is armed with massive strike power. How the Path managed to acquire it is best not thought about…",,,,
bc_galliard_p,SHIP,"This Galliard-class destroyer is a prime example of pirate engineering. Canisters of defensive flak are ripped out, subsystems mangled, and vents collapsed to install a state of the art ammo feeder into the frame of this ship. Using this powerful system, the ship can pose a threat to all but the largest ships in the Sector, although it is stripped of any defensive capability.",,,,
bc_midlinebricc,SHIP,"Born from the same design team that created the Champion, the Chosen sacrifices the older design’s missile mount in return for a large ballistic one, lending the ship a higher sustainability in combat. It also has a strong defensive armament and advanced armor, and with a low speed it fits the role of fleet anchor nicely. While some might regard it as the inferior sibling of the Champion, this ship has a trick up its sleeve: the elite Strike Burn system allows it to leap out of position to strike fleeing ships with temporarily boosted weapons.",,,,
,,,,,,
bc_phasefrigate1,SHIP,"A fast, nimble phase vessel, the Roland-class is a valuable tool in any fleet for its capability to capture strategic zones and flank larger vessels. Less valuable are its paper-thin armor, fragile design and the strange refusal of its in-built phase kitchen to cook food properly.",,,,
bc_phasefrigate2,SHIP,"A cheap frigate generally thought of as a shoddy design, this phase vessel sports an inefficient, unruly coil system that lends it its unsavory reputation. The cause of a record-breaking twenty-eight lawsuits against the Fays Corporation, this frigate is nevertheless thought of as a commercial success due to its low cost and incorporation of a Polgram-5000 Uberkaffee coffee maker.",,,,
bc_phasefrigate3,SHIP,"A cannibalized Vanguard-class, this variant boasts a phase cloak and a high-grade ammo feeder. One of the few Fays Co. designs thought to be an acceptable alternative to other phase ships, this vessel was naturally recalled only 4 cycles after production due to complaints of chipping corridor paint. However, post-Collapse Fays Co. Sales Department saw the value to be had in this ship and soon restarted manufacturing the variant.",,,,
bc_phasedestroyer1,SHIP,"What may be mistaken by some for a derelict Harbinger is in fact a wholly unique ship! The Blevins has light weaponry, sacrificing attack power for a powerful electromagnetic emitter mounted on the front of the ship, allowing it to unleash destructive bursts of disabling arcs. Claimed by the Fays Corporation to be unrelated in any way to the Harbinger, Tri-Tachyon nonetheless launched a thorough investigation into the ship and its origins. The results were inconclusive, as although the Blevins does bear a striking resemblance to the Harbinger, the internal workings are entirely the design of the Fays Corporation. Despite this, Tri-Tachyon launched a campaign of lawsuits which severely impacted the Blevins’ commercial success.",,,,
bc_phasedestroyer2,SHIP,"A (relatively) well armored phase ship, the Bertrand’s odd design and lack of proper waste disposal systems grant the vessel a unique reputation. While capable of fielding significant firepower and using its Microjump system to flank enemies, the ship is slow and can be caught out by heavy firepower. Despite being one of the Fays Corporation’s most distinctive products, the Bertrand was found to contain parts almost exclusively from Tri-Tachyon’s Harbinger-class, causing one of the most long-running (and cutthroat) lawsuits in the Sector to date.",,,,
bc_phasedestroyer3,SHIP,"One of the numerous conversions of common hulls carried out by the Fays Corporation, this Shrike variant is dubious in its quality, and mediocre in its performance. Although a decent all-rounder, this vessel is truly a master of none and will fall easily to any anti-phase ship. Despite the underwhelming performance, this Fays Co. product won the hearts of independent buyers for its comfortable, albeit bizarre in layout, crew compartments.",,,,
bc_phasecruiser1,SHIP,"Truly a bizarre ship, this Eagle-class was extensively modified by the Fays Corporation to sport a phase cloak and a state-of-the-art Microjump system (If state-of-the-art means mediocre at best). A common sight among Fays Co. defense fleets, this conversion is one of the mainstays of the elite Marketing Corps for its (relative) reliability and flexible armament package.",,,,
bc_phasecruiser2,SHIP,"One of the few ships produced by the Fays Corporation to have a positive reputation, the Alcott-class is a powerful phase ship that can surprise enemies with a powerful weapons array and bursts of massive speed. Despite this, the ship is very specialized as the role of the vessel is decided almost entirely upon what is mounted in the large spinal slot. In part due to its powerful systems, the Alcott is regarded with suspicion by Tri-Tachyon, though surreptitious investigations have not (yet) yielded evidence of the undoubtedly stolen design.",,,,
bc_phasecruiser3,SHIP,"Recognizing the lack of missile support in corporate fleets, Fays Co. Research and Development designed the Gladstone to bring a heavy armament of missiles and a rapid reload system to the battlefield. Highly effective in a fleet setting, the Gladstone specializes in destroying overloaded targets before they can escape. However, the ship is left helpless once its missiles are exhausted, making it a poor choice for sustained engagements.",,,,
bc_phasefreighter,SHIP,"The ship that launched the Fays Corporation’s ship design branch, the Atticus is a wildly successful phase hauler renowned for its cheapness and reviled for its unruly phase coil. An amazingly popular hull among traders of ill-repute, the Atticus is loathed by planetary authorities due to its stealth. Several governments and companies have attempted to gain compensation from the Fays Co. for the extensive unrest the vessel has caused, but post-Collapse these suits rarely go anywhere.",,,,
bc_phasehauler,SHIP,"The larger counterpart to the Atticus, the Hester-class phase freighter is similarly ubiquitous among smugglers and pirates who wish for their fleets to remain unscrupulous. Slightly less common than its smaller cousin, the Hester is more expensive and lacks any defense at all, leaving it especially vulnerable if caught by combat-rated ships.",,,,
bc_phasetanker,SHIP,"Developed by the Fays Corporation to supply long-range fleets while remaining stealthy, the Norman is a phase tanker with few noteworthy features. Occasionally used by dedicated smugglers to sneak through blockades, the Norman is otherwise inefficient compared to ordinary tankers like the universal Dram-class.",,,,
bc_phasefreighter_p,SHIP,"This Fays Co. vessel has been given a piratical paint job, and now flies with the more unsavory fleets in the Sector. How the pirates gained such a vessel is better not thought about…

The ship that launched the Fays Corporation’s ship design branch, the Atticus is a wildly successful phase hauler renowned for its cheapness and reviled for its unruly phase coil. An amazingly popular hull among traders of ill-repute, the Atticus is loathed by planetary authorities due to its stealth. Several governments and companies have attempted to gain compensation from the Fays Co. for the extensive unrest the vessel has caused, but post-Collapse these suits rarely go anywhere.",,,,
bc_phasehauler_p,SHIP,"This Fays Co. vessel has been given a piratical paint job, and now flies with the more unsavory fleets in the Sector. How the pirates gained such a vessel is better not thought about…

The larger counterpart to the Atticus, the Hester-class phase freighter is similarly ubiquitous among smugglers and pirates who wish for their fleets to remain unscrupulous. Slightly less common than its smaller cousin, the Hester is more expensive and lacks any defense at all, leaving it especially vulnerable if caught by combat-rated ships.",,,,
bc_phaseparagon,SHIP,"A ship of dubious reputation, this Paragon-class has been horribly modified by the shrewd Fays Corporation to host an array of phase coils, allowing it to plunge into the abyss of p-space. While terrifying at first sight, the ship is soon revealed to be a paltry imitation of the Paragon and will crumple rapidly due to its inefficient coils. Legendary among ship engineers for its atrocious design decisions, limitations of phase technology mean the hull of this vessel is actually completely hollow in some places to reduce mass. While appalling, these concessions are necessary to allow the colossal ship to enter p-space. Rarely used due to its impracticality and cost.",,,,
bc_fayshound,SHIP,"A Hound-class combat freighter that has been modified by the Fays Corporation to host a low-grade phase field generator for stealth purposes. Generally considered an upgrade of the rugged, albeit dated ship.",,,,
bc_fayslasher,SHIP,"A Lasher-class frigate that has been modified by the Fays Corporation to host a low-grade phase field generator for stealth purposes. Thought to be a useful, although certainly eccentric upgrade.",,,,
bc_phasefrigate4,SHIP,"A refit of an advanced Tempest-class, this version sports a Fays Co. brand phase coil while still possessing state-of-the-art Terminator Drones. However, these modifications come at the cost of firepower, leaving the ship somewhat underwhelming.",,,,
bc_miningdoom,SHIP,"One of the Fays Corporation’s most bizarre ships, this ship is a disgustingly modified Doom-class that is augmented with built-in Mining Blasters. The advanced Mine Strike system was gutted and replaced with a mining charge teleporter, allowing the Meus to be a boon to any mining operation and damage unwary ships.",,,,
bc_orion_capital,SHIP,"While the antiquated Retribution is regarded as an odd make of ship, the Reprisal is even odder. With a thick armor belt and the powerful Orion Device, this capital ship has both power as a fleet anchor and to chase down enemies. However, weaker armament compared to other ships of its class and a slow base speed mean it struggles to win decisively or retreat in the face of a stronger foe.

The incomplete blueprint for this strange ship was found in a dusty databank drifting through the outer reaches of the Persean Sector by the Luddic Church, who experimentally completed the design and put it into limited service. 
",,,,
bc_hightech_cruiser,SHIP,"Filling an interesting niche in high tech fleets, the Tachocline attempts to recreate the Paragon-class’ stubborn defiance in a cruiser-sized hull. With high-efficiency shields and the Fortress Shield system, the Tachocline can soak up heavy damage. With its high-tech construction, it has increased zero flux boost, which allows the ship to have high mobility on the strategic level. However, its speed is pitiful once flux is generated, meaning it struggles to retreat from engagements.",,,,
bc_faysco_boss,SHIP,You shouldn't have this.,,,,
,,,,,,
bc_midlinefighter1,SHIP,"The Bardiche is a strange design, seemingly born from the desire to create a fighter that can do everything passably but nothing particularly well. This fighter has a shield core, decent speed and mobility, and a decent hull rating. These design elements leave little room for the fighter’s flux core, though, and so the ship can field only lightly damaging weapons, albeit with EMP properties. These weapons, while weak against shields, can disable ships and fighters, making them vulnerable to anti-ship and point defense weapons, respectively.",,,,
bc_antiquefighter,SHIP,"This antique LPC is exceedingly rare, as it is usually bought by rich collectors as soon as one is discovered (a rare event in and of itself). However, this fighter is a powerful tool, armed with dual ultralight pareidolia cannons, the ship is able to quickly dismantle enemy fighters and pose a threat to any unprepared ships. Utilizing a powerful shield generator and robust flux grid, this fighter is also able to take a hit—unless its shield is breached, exposing a weakly armored hull.",,,,
bc_antiquefighter2,SHIP,"A unique fighter, the Acolle is very lightly armed, wielding two very weak sublight beams. However, it is built around large magazines of distracting flares, allowing it to harass enemy ships and cripple their point defense networks. Its generous armor belt and hull also allow it to soak up damage and continue deploying flares. Due to the lack of offensive armament, it is best when fielded along with strike fighters.",,,,
bc_gunship,SHIP,"A truly massive strike craft, the Noxal is one of, if not the largest fighter launched from a carrier. With ample armor, hull, shielding, and offensive armament, the Noxal is a force to be reckoned with. However, its speed means it is often outmaneuvered by fast ships or fighters.",,,,
bc_hightechfighter1,SHIP,"The sister ship of the Xyphos, this nimble strike fighter utilizes a displacer system to quickly pounce on targets or retreat to the carrier to avoid destruction. Armed with repurposed dual PD Burst Lasers, this ship is effective against other fighters but requires EMP support from its companion fighter, the Xyphos, to survive point defense attacks.",,,,
bc_acfighter,SHIP,"An old fighter design, this odd craft is built around a massive underslung cannon. Utilized by the Luddic Church, these fighters are effective at suppressing and overloading enemy ships in large groups.",,,,
bc_lowtech_trident,SHIP,"Either an ancient version of the Trident bomber, or a hackjob alternative, this fighter wields two Hammer torpedoes in place of its high-tech cousin’s Atropos racks. This low-tech derivative lacks shields, but sports increased armor.",,,,
bc_breachbomber,SHIP,"A cheap, effective bomber, the Rent is dubbed a fast bomber due to its range and quickness, allowing it to quickly strike vulnerable targets. Its Breach SRMs are also effective at swamping enemy PD grids with ordnance, although the actual strike potential of these weapons is subpar compared to other bombers.",,,,
bc_doublebomber,SHIP,"A unique ‘hybrid bomber’, the Exarch carries two missiles, each with different payloads. Using one kinetic and one high explosive warhead, this bomber can deliver a powerful ‘one-two punch’, bringing down enemy shields before following with an explosive wallop.",,,,
bc_racingfighter,SHIP,"Originally a one-crew racing pinnace, the Trice is unmatched when it comes to raw speed and agility. However, soon after the Collapse canny engineers saw the potential in a blazing-fast fighter and jury-rigged the craft to hold light weaponry. The result was disappointing—the vessel was unable to mount any serious firepower, and is now only used for distractions or suppressing small ships like frigates.",,,,
bc_midlinefighter2,SHIP,"Developed for a unique Domain military contract, the Aardwolf is a support fighter meant to bolster a carrier’s fighting power while protecting it from missile strikes. With a powerful weapons package and an advanced sensor array, this craft is able to deal significant long-ranged kinetic support.",,,,
bc_phasefighter,SHIP,"A design created by the Fays Corporation solely for export, the Fleuret was a source of great concern for the Domain as the prospect of a phase fighter making its way into the hands of malcontents was a frightening one. However, upon its debut the Fleuret was generally a disappointment, as the miniaturized phase coil was only usable for a short time with the craft’s weak flux core, and the ship’s armament was negligible. Often used by independent mercenaries or pirates who wish to show off their flashy arsenal, the Fleuret is generally a weak fighter.",,,,
bc_thumper_fighter,SHIP,"Often referred to as a ""thumper with wings”, the Chark-class fighter is built around a Thumper cannon, giving it a heavy (if unwieldy) armament. Utilized by the traditional Hegemony, the Chark is an effective tool at suppressing weakly shielded ships and finishing off damaged ones with its fragmentation weapon. ",,,,
bc_thermo_drone,SHIP,"A drone fighter regarded with intense scrutiny by traditionalist factions, the Witchknot is a unique bomber utilizing a powerful energy weapon. However, the ship’s flux core cannot hold the strain of the massive burst of energy, and thus explodes violently when the weapon is fired. Written off as a failed experiment by the craft’s designers, the Witchknot was recovered after the Collapse and put into use as a ‘suicide bomber’.",,,,
bc_midlineinterceptor,SHIP,"An aggressive attack fighter, the Jerboa is often thought of as a specialized Broadsword. With less armor and hull rating, but increased speed and offensive armament, the Jerboa can engage other fighters effectively. However, it may struggle to survive point-defense networks.",,,,
bc_hightech_superfighter,SHIP,"Utilizing several highly advanced systems, the Hushallsost packs a monstrous amount of firepower into a small frame. With a spinal Phase Lance and two Defender Drones, this superfighter is the bane of any lightly armored foe. However, heavy armor or heavy point-defense can easily overcome the fighter's firepower and fragile hull.",,,,
,,,,,,
bc_builtin2,WEAPON,"A supremely effective autocannon, the Dedicant is a powerful tool exclusive to the Limerence and Lacustrine frigates. With a strong explosive payload, the weapon unfortunately cannot be made modular due to strange quirks in the ammo autofactory. This version fires explosive rounds.",,,,
bc_builtin2_alt,WEAPON,"A supremely effective autocannon, the Dedicant is a powerful tool exclusive to the Limerence and Lacustrine frigates. With a strong kinetic payload, the weapon unfortunately cannot be made modular due to strange quirks in the ammo autofactory. This version fires kinetic rounds.",,,,
bc_antiquecannon_large,WEAPON,"Essentially two Pareidolia Cannons in one, this weapon is a potent tool for destroying ships with downed shields. While the damage of each shot is comparable to the medium variant, higher fire rate means this weapon can be devastating. Like all Pareidolias, the autoloader on this weapon is slow and has to recharge for some time before another full volley can be fired.",,,,
bc_antiquecannon_med,WEAPON,"This cannon is a unique find—its designers are unknown, and its mechanics are nigh-improbable. Utilizing strange exotic particles, this cannon charges its ammunition with energy, granting the shots a unique trail of high-energy radiation. Effective at tearing apart enemy armor, this weapon is a valuable tool for frontline ships.",,,,
bc_antiquecannon_small,WEAPON,"This miniaturized version of the Pareidolia Cannon retains much of the offensive capabilities of its larger cousin, but the smaller frame means the autoloader struggles to keep up. ",,,,
bc_antiquecannon_fighter,WEAPON,"A fighter-mounted Pareidolia, this cannon has low damage but makes up for it in superior projectile speed and fire rate.",,,,
bc_airburst,WEAPON,"An area denial weapon used for suppressing ships and taking out fighters, this cannon fires shells containing bursts of volatile particles that split and strike whole areas with fire. However, it is flux-inefficient, and has low burst damage due to the spread of the projectiles.",,,,
bc_emp_msl_lcher,WEAPON,"An exotic weapon, the Raniform functions as a backline support tool for pressuring enemies and catching them off-guard with a glowing spray of EMP charged particles. The missile functions as a MIRV, and with its spray of projectiles having a high range it is unlikely to be intercepted by point defense. While these particles have devastating EMP effects, hull damage is negligible and shields can absorb them without much issue.",,,,
bc_swarmer,WEAPON,"The designers of this weapon weren’t happy with the Locust, and wanted a weapon that could overwhelm PD networks and suppress enemies, allowing other missiles and strikes through. Utilizing efficient engines, the missiles have long range, making the weapon suited for backline support. However, to accommodate the massive volleys of missiles, the warheads are weak and the ammo regeneration is slow. ",,,,
bc_mishmash,WEAPON,This weapon is technically a starting point for an industrial particle accelerator with most of the assembly removed. The volatile particles launched from this weapon deal massive damage to armor but are quickly dissipated by shields and deal only small damage to hull. Despite its makeshift nature it is quite reliable and sees wide use.,,,,
bc_breach_srm_fighter,WEAPON,A smaller variant of the Breach SRM for use on fighters. It only mounts two missiles as opposed to the fifteen usually carried.,,,,
bc_chargebeam,WEAPON,"An odd weapon, this beam uses several reactive chemicals to power a volatile beam. This beam reacts strangely with shield systems, as it causes explosions that behave similarly to kinetic weapons. However, the weapon’s charges are limited and damage to armor is negligible.",,,,
bc_fighter_hammer_single,WEAPON,A single Hammer-class torpedo adjusted to be mounted on the Dangpa-class bomber. Slight changes lend this weapon minor inaccuracy.,,,,
bc_navalcannon,WEAPON,"An efficient large caliber gun for suppressing enemies and supporting allies from the rear, this cannon fires a burst of shells that can deal heavy damage to unprotected targets. However, slow projectile speeds make this area denial tool difficult to use against fast targets.",,,,
bc_k_missile1,WEAPON,"A short-ranged missile unique to the Exarch-class, this weapon has a moderate kinetic payload.",,,,
bc_he_missile1,WEAPON,"A short-ranged missile unique to the Exarch-class, this weapon has a moderate high-explosive payload.",,,,
bc_cannon,WEAPON,"A weapon unique to the Legitimator-class fighter, this weapon has moderate firepower but good fire rate, making it useful for general purpose combat.",,,,
bc_thumper,WEAPON,"A rotatory cannon with generous engineering specifications which provide for great ease of operation and reliability. Weapons officers across the professional navies of the Sector, meanwhile, curse the Thumper for rewarding poor maintenance habits. 

Shreds enemy missiles and fighters with an overwhelming hail of small payload, medium velocity fragmentation rounds. Although flux-efficient, this weapon system has little effect against armor and shields.",,,,
bc_pirategun,WEAPON,"A veritable mish-mash of weapon parts, bolted panels, and bizarrely, a coffee maker, the Cobblegun is a makeshift weapon firing bursts of kinetic shrapnel. Due to the instability of the firing mechanisms the weapon is woefully inaccurate and rounds are known to shatter upon leaving the barrel.",,,,
bc_cluster_msl,WEAPON,"A short-ranged MIRV weapon, the Votary fires a burst of unguided, armored high explosive bombs some distance away from its target to limit the chance of being intercepted by point-defense.",,,,
bc_energycannon,WEAPON,"Born from an attempt to ‘modernize’ the venerable Hellbore Cannon, the Heimdall is a fiendishly complicated weapon utilizing several exotic technologies to fire a massive plasma-charged warhead. Highly effective at any role, but comes at the cost of increased flux use compared to its predecessor.",,,,
bc_largesalamander,WEAPON,"Homes in on the target's engines and disables them with a powerful EMP burst. A combat-rated autoloader system ensures usefulness in protracted engagements.

The Salamander missile is a specialized weapon with two design considerations. The first is an extremely advanced tracking/targeting mechanism which enables it to home in on enemy engines, whilst avoiding all other potential impact points and Point Defense threats.

The second is a special warhead design which, instead of attempting to destroy the target with kinetic or explosive force, generates targeted electromagnetic fields of high magnitude.

qanat,CUSTOM,"A once-prosperous mining colony, this independent world was stricken with pirate raids and civil unrest following the Collapse. After a few years of chaos, the planetary government was crippled, and only the heavily fortified orbital astropolis remained under civilized control. Now, roving bands of survivors live in isolated pockets, eking out a tortured existence under Deixis’ harsh rays.",,,,
faystation,CUSTOM,"After the collapse of authority on Qanat, the Polstein-based Fays Corporation saw an opportunity to seize power in the chaos. Launching a brutal coup, the corporation managed to eliminate the astropoli's surviving leadership and take control of the helpless station. After a long period of anti-corporation insurgency, Fays Co. managed to silence remaining dissenters and develop the station into an industrial powerhouse.",,,,
polstein,CUSTOM,"While Fays Station is the de-facto capital of the Fays Co., the megacorporation got its start manufacturing cheap components on the arid hills of Polstein. A landscape of blackened clouds and drifting microplastics, Polstein is a bleak world bearing the ugly scars of human advancement. The soil of this planet is exploited with brutal efficiency to feed the hungry mouths of the Deixis system, and quotas are reaching ever-higher to fulfill corporate needs.",,,,
knarl,CUSTOM,"A cold, unforgiving world, Knarl is a monotonous icy landscape interrupted only by endless lines of massive drilling arrays and the occasional ammonia volcano. The population of this freezing rock is made up of either destitute miners or dissidents sentenced to a life of eternal work in the hazardous extraction plants, only kept in check by the nearby Garrison Post Kappa. ",,,,
garrison_post,CUSTOM,"Once a humble research post dedicated to the study of the exotic phenomena of the volatile giant Roberts, this station was quickly claimed and fortified by the opportunistic Fays Corporation following the Collapse. Arrays of volatile collectors, sensors, and labs were torn out and replaced with heavy batteries, flux banks, and armor to convert the station into a formidable bastion. Now used by the corporation to control the outer Deixis system, Garrison Post Kappa keeps the unruly world of Knarl in line while preventing enterprising pirates from entering the system.",,,,
tenskull,CUSTOM,"A miserable planet home to the dubious Alliance Against Corporate Control, this world was settled by anti-corporation dissidents after the Fays Corporation’s rise to power. While they originally held a tenuously neutral relationship to the company, worsening conditions following the Collapse led many residents of Ten Skulls to turn to piracy. Now considered nothing but a nuisance by the Fays Corporation, the Alliance has escaped destruction only due to the complex internal politics of the megacorp.",,,,
roberts,CUSTOM,"A bizarre planet, Roberts is composed of several exotic elements which react strongly to the immense pressures near the world’s core, causing severe disruptions in the atmosphere which manifest in global superstorms. The planet's violet hue and swirling clouds are known to be hauntingly beautiful, and orbiting bodies are given a stunning view of crackling lightning and fierce maelstroms.",,,,
waterloo,CUSTOM,"Established a few decades after the Persean League’s formation, Port Waterloo was founded to facilitate trade and diplomacy between the Fays Corporation and the Persean League, marking an important milestone in the cooperation between the two powers. A source of worry for the Hegemony, an alliance between the megacorp and the League is a frightening prospect.",,,,
,,,,,,
faysco,FACTION,"An opportunistic megacorporation that used the chaos following the Collapse to seize power in the Deixis system via coups, espionage and abuse of the corporate legal system, the Fays Corporation is a shady conglomerate of consumer goods manufacturers and industrial shipyard companies. Led by an elusive board of directors that seem to always know their opponents’ next move, the corporation would have certainly gained far more power if not for the general shoddiness of their products (and ships).

The Fays Corporation is considered a wild-card by many factions in the Sector due in part to their perpetually neutral stance on artificial intelligence, and thus the AI Wars. While cores are technically illegal in Fays Co. space, the corporation’s lax trade restrictions lead to intense scrutiny from the traditional Luddic Church and Hegemony. The corporation is also overtly disruptive of Tri-Tachyon interests, and is a natural competitor for the rival megacorp. Corporate espionage between these two companies is extensive, and minor back-and-forth conflicts occur almost every cycle in the form of proxy conflicts or skirmishes. The only major power friendly to the unpredictable Fays Corporation is the Persean League, thanks to the considerable amount of trading and economic activity that occurs between the two western polities.",,,,
