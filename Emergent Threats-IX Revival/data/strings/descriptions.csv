ix_battlegroup,FACTION,"In cycle 70, a large fleet of high-tech warships limped into the Persean Sector, having been placed in emergency cryosleep for decades after the gate network collapse. The arrival of a 9th Domain Battlegroup task force was initially welcomed by the Hegemony, who hoped to settle the newcomers and make use of their advanced technology. However, negotiations suddenly turned violent for reasons that remain classified, resulting in a massive battle over the skies of Jangala. The task force was defeated by the narrowest of margins, and withdrew their remaining ships to a system on the edge of the Core Worlds, where they have maintained a state of perpetual war against every other major polity of the Sector ever since.

Often referred to simply as ""the Fleet,"" the IX Battlegroup sees itself as the true inheritor of the Domain of Man. Fleet Command governs the Zorya system under a strict military dictatorship, using both naval and economic force projection to constantly destabilize the rest of the Sector. Before its worlds are reclaimed for the Domain, free captains and mercenaries are tolerated as useful pawns. Everyone else is prey.",,,
,,,,,
axiom_ix,SHIP,"Fast and heavily shielded 9th Domain Battlegroup interceptor, equipped with an emergency flux shunt that keeps the craft operational even when its shields are overloaded. Prior to its arrival in the Persean Sector, the mission profile of the Fleet had placed a heavy emphasis on minimizing attrition, and so for much of its history it did not operate with crewed fighters. That has recently begun to change, with the Axiom appearing in large numbers in the defense of its orbital facilities.",,,
banteng_base,SHIP,"A freighter that combines ample cargo space with extended range fuel tanks, alleviating the need for dedicated tanker ships when hauling long distance freight. Rarely seen while Gate travel was still ubiquitous, the Banteng has found renewed popularity post-Collapse as a commercial hauler, exploration vessel, and even militarized fleet tender. Its excellent range and relatively robust weapon mounts make it well suited to operating on the lawless frontier.",,,
buffalo_ix,SHIP,"Despite being ruggedized, the Buffalo (IX) is still a light freighter, and must rely upon escorts to survive coming under fire.",,,
dictum_ix,SHIP,"A cutting edge heavy fighter of the 9th Domain Battlegroup, bearing the same emergency flux shunt as its interceptor counterpart. The Dictum is almost guaranteed to outmatch any other comparable strike craft in a one-on-one engagement. However, its extremely demanding maintenance requirements limit its deployment in large numbers.",,,
flamebreaker_ix,SHIP,"Based on a high-tech cruiser hull that has long been known to the Fleet, but never put into service due to its relatively slow speed, the heavily revised Flamebreaker (IX) has finally found its place as the 9th Domain Battlegroup's latest combat carrier. The advanced sensors of the preceding design have been fine tuned for both point defense and flight command, while a robust fighter autoforge and launch bay have taken the place of heavy missile armaments.",,,
flourish_stock,SHIP,"A nimble attack frigate with the capability to mount both ballistic and energy weapons. Features a secondary shield system wired to an independent plasma core, allowing for both shields to be used simultaneously and for shielding to be maintained while overloaded or actively venting flux.

Sharing many similarities to the older Lasher-class, the Flourish is a late Expansion Epoch update of its aged predecessor, with numerous changes to reflect the strike focused doctrine of its creation. Post-Collapse, the Tri-Tachyon Corporation secured a partial blueprint of the design from the 9th Domain Battlegroup in a daring feat of corporate espionage. While they could not fully replicate its most cutting edge features, Tri-Tachyon did manage to alter the hardpoint mounts to accomidate a more diverse range of weapons for their mass production variant.",,,
flourish_ix,SHIP,"A nimble and versatile attack frigate featuring a novel secondary shield system wired to an independent plasma core. The Flourish (IX) actually predates its more commonplace downgraded variant in the Sector, having arrived with the original 9th Domain Battlegroup taskforce. The secrets of its fully enveloping undershield could not be replicated by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation even after they stole the design blueprints.",,,
iconoclast_ix,SHIP,"Based on the slow and defense oriented Iris-class destroyer, the Iconoclast (IX) has been radically re-envisioned as a light carrier with the speed to keep up with the rest of the Fleet. It is equipped with advanced point defense systems and a compact Interdictor Array, making it the bane of any ship that seeks to outmaneuver or flee from an invading flotilla.",,,
incursion_ix,SHIP,"Envisioned as a radical upgrade of the Incursion-class battleship, which was itself already the intended high-tech replacement for the venerable Onslaught-class battleships still serving with the Domain Armada, the Incursion (IX) has been outfitted with several exotic technologies developed by the 9th Domain Battlegroup following their arrival in the Persean Sector. The ship is fast and deadly in a frontal assault, especially when its vulnerable flanks are well protected as part of a large formation.",,,
odyssey_ix,SHIP,"An heavily modified Odyssey-class battlecruiser, partly based on the technology reverse engineered from a Tri-Tachyon militarized hull captured in the defense of Zorya, but also bearing various alterations unique to the 9th Domain Battlegroup. The biggest change to the hull is its built-in heavy ordnance launcher, which completely replaces the primary hangar bay. The repurposed drone fabricators ensure a steady supply of long range cruise missiles even during protracted engagements.",,,
radiant_ix,SHIP,"Many of the systems onboard have been deliberately downgraded to allow the converted droneship to be operated safely by its human crew. Nonetheless, the IX Battlegroup have successfully modified the hull with their own standard fleetwide enhancements, making the Radiant (IX) one of the most formidable warships of the Sector.",,,
temblor_ix,SHIP,"Due to a long history of conducting remote missions with minimal resupply, the Fleet has traditionally eschewed the use of fragile combat drones. However, adhering strictly to past doctrine is a luxury it can no longer afford. The Temblor (IX) is intended to be the first step in rapidly closing the gap with the numerous hostile polities in the Sector that possess far greater expertise in fighter deployment.",,,
terminus_ix,SHIP,"An experimental combat drone based on the already capable Terminator, the Terminus (IX) has been fine tuned to utilize its Morningstar Close-In Weapon System to the greatest possible effect. It is an extremely capable missile interceptor, upon which the crews of Fleet entrust with their lives.",,,
tigershark_ix,SHIP,"A high-tech cruiser that shares many design elements with the Aurora, each Tigershark (IX) is painstakingly retrofitted after forge production to address the numerous minor yet notable flaws that plague the base template. The end result is a highly specialized hunter-killer, produced in extremely limited numbers for the most elite units of the 9th Domain Battlegroup.",,,

ix_interdictor,SHIP_SYSTEM,Emits a heavy graviton beam at the target that deals kinetic damage and potentially disables engines.,Offensive,,
ix_plasmajets,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a brief but extreme boost to top speed, along with a slight maneuverability boost.",Movement,,
ix_rapid_assembly,SHIP_SYSTEM,Immediately replace all lost and expended strike craft. Has a long cooldown and generates flux when used.,Fighter,,
ix_terminus_relay,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Relay a charged particle stream via deployed Terminus (IX) drones, inflicting energy and EMP damage at the nearest enemy ship to each drone. The same ship can be hit by both drones. Generates flux when used.",Offensive,,
,,,,,
antecedent_ix,WEAPON,"This ponderous but incredibly well armored heavy cruise missile carries a powerful wide dispersal warhead. When detonated, it alters the vacuum energy of the surrounding area to a far higher baseline, resembling the conditions of an earlier cosmological epoch. The effect is transitory but devastating. Only the firing ship can avoid the worst of the anomaly. All others nearby shall find themselves engulfed by the burning firmament.",,,
conversion_lance_ix,WEAPON,"A rare example of a weapon in the IX Battlegroup arsenal specifically intended to counter heavy armor. The Conversion Lance generates short lived magnetic monopoles at the point of impact, explosively converting the entire trailing particle stream's mass into energy. The effect is nothing short of ruinous against exposed armor. ",,,
cutting_beam_ix,WEAPON,A refinement upon the IR Autolance that meets the stringent requirements demanded by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Its impressive performance could only be achieved by directly incorporating the massive beam emitter into the hull of an upgraded Incursion-class battleship.,,,
diffraction_laser_ix,WEAPON,"A dynamically modulated shield penetrating laser. This effect is usually little more than a curiosity, since the low powered beam is barely able to scratch the paint on hull plating. However, the coherent laser backscattering can be used to infer weak points in any intervening shield barrier, allowing other more capable weapons to impose greater flux against the illuminated target.",,,
es_projector_ix,WEAPON,"An exotic ""dust gun"" that accelerates micrometer pellets of fissile material in a continuous high velocity particle cloud. Impact results in a deadly combination of kinetic force and micro-fission ignition, rapidly degrading even the most powerful shield emitters, while still remaining moderately useful against reinforced armor.",,,
interdictor_iris_ix,WEAPON,"A scaled down variant of the Interdictor Array, mounted in a fixed forward position in place of a Fortress Shield. This device has a shorter range and is far more taxing on the reactor when fired compared to the battleship scale version, but remains just as effective at disrupting shields and ensnaring fleeing ships. Captains trained by the 9th Domain Battlegroup can achieve a faster rate of fire without the need for special modifications.",,,
lightbringer_ciws_ix,WEAPON,"An upscaled Morningstar CIWS in twin barrel configuration, achieving an even greater volume of fire. An effective point defense weapon that can also pressure shields at close range, it is hopelessly outmatched by heavy armor.",,,
lightbringer_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A simplified fighter variant of the Lightbringer CIWS, intended for close range assault rather than point defense. Effective against shields and lightly defended targets, but performs very poorly again heavy armor.",,,
micrograser_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"The Micrograser takes one of the most capable and deadly capital grade energy weapons ever devised by the Domain, and drastically reduces its size while preserving much of its firepower. The redesign is incompatible with standard weapon mounts, but is well suited for a heavy fighter specifically built around the emitter.",,,
morningstar_ciws_ix,WEAPON,"A modified burst fire IR Pulse Laser with far greater rate of fire and integrated point defense tracking. It is more effective in ship-to-ship combat compared to most point defense weapons, but is relatively power hungry, and performs extremely poorly against heavy armor.",,,
morningstar_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A prototype continuous fire Morningstar CIWS. Despite the relatively modest upgrades, persistent overheating issues have so far limited its adoption to the Terminus (IX) combat drone.",,,
muon_autolance_ix,WEAPON,"An advanced particle weapon of the late Expansion Epoch, widely used by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. This heavy muon beam emitter achieves even greater energy output and EMP discharge compared to the streamer variant, but its internal capacitors can only sustain firing for several seconds before needing to recharge.",,,
muon_streamer_ix,WEAPON,"An advanced particle weapon of the late Expansion Epoch, widely used by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Fires bursts of short lived muons which instantly decay into high energy electrons upon impact. While the EMP discharge is less intense than specialized ion weapons and cannot pierce shields, the overall energy output significantly outpaces most other beam emitters of its weight class.",,,
orthrus_s_ix,WEAPON,"A hybrid DEM torpedo that packs a powerful one-two punch, the Orthrus engages an enemy in two stages, first unleashing a high intensity plasma beam, before detonating the rest of its payload upon impact. While a versatile weapon, its limited tracking ability is not suited for engaging fast moving targets.

The few records that exist for this weapon suggest it was developed shortly prior to the Collapse, and utilizes plasma containment technology derived from the Domain's stellar engineering projects. Several field trial prototypes were present among the 9th Domain Battlegroup task force stranded within the Persean Sector. It is a testament to their technological prowess that the weapons were not only reverse engineered, but also put into mass production.",,,
orthrus_m_ix,WEAPON,"A hybrid DEM torpedo that packs a powerful one-two punch, the Orthrus engages an enemy in two stages, first unleashing a high intensity plasma beam, before detonating the rest of its payload upon impact. While a versatile weapon, its limited tracking ability is not suited for engaging fast moving targets.

The few records that exist for this weapon suggest it was developed shortly prior to the Collapse, and utilizes plasma containment technology derived from the Domain's stellar engineering projects. Several field trial prototypes were present among the 9th Domain Battlegroup task force stranded within the Persean Sector. It is a testament to their technological prowess that the weapons were not only reverse engineered, but also put into mass production.

This enlarged torpedo launcher packs more ammunition for extended engagements.",,,
orthrus_l_ix,WEAPON,"A hybrid DEM torpedo that packs a powerful one-two punch, the Orthrus engages an enemy in two stages, first unleashing a high intensity plasma beam, before detonating the rest of its payload upon impact. While a versatile weapon, its limited tracking ability is not suited for engaging fast moving targets.

The few records that exist for this weapon suggest it was developed shortly prior to the Collapse, and utilizes plasma containment technology derived from the Domain's stellar engineering projects. Several field trial prototypes were present among the 9th Domain Battlegroup task force stranded within the Persean Sector. It is a testament to their technological prowess that the weapons were not only reverse engineered, but also put into mass production.

This heavy salvo launcher can fire two torpedoes at once, and is also equipped with a more advanced autoloader.",,,
sbe_ix,WEAPON,"The Soliton Burst Emitter was developed from examples of the Hellfire SDEM secured by the 9th Domain Battlegroup. Unlike its crude predecessor, this weapon is powered directly by the main reactor of a specially modified battleship, and exploits complex n-brane physics to generate a topological defect in space-time at the point of impact. Anything caught by the anomaly is quickly torn apart by unimaginable tidal forces.",,,
starfall_mlrs_ix,WEAPON,"Derived from the Locust missile system, the Starfall MLRS is an unguided weapon that fires swarms of electrogravitic resonator rockets designed to both swiftly collapse shields and disable exposed systems. Each projectile is charged by the main reactor immediately prior to launch, which imparts a notable flux load on the firing ship.",,,
starfall_fighter_ix,WEAPON,"A secondary weapon for the Axiom (IX), these rockets allow the interceptor to pressure the shields of larger enemy ships, and suppress vulnerable systems once the shields are down.",,,
starfall_rocket_ix,WEAPON,"A downscaled Starfall MLRS that fires swarms of unguided electrogravitic resonator rockets, effective at both overwhelming shields and disabling exposed systems. Unlike most missile weapons, the need to charge each warhead before launch imparts a notable flux load on the firing ship.",,,
stormlight_graser_ix,WEAPON,"A gamma ray burst laser that achieves staggering power output by utilizing positronium Bose-Einstein condensate as its gain medium. Has poor beam cohesion for a capital ship laser, but is very flux efficient due to most of the power being generated by the laser medium itself. Suspending antimatter in liquid helium is a lost art post-Collapse, making this laser a modern day relic.

The experimental Gamma Ray Antimatter Impelled Laser or GRAIL system was undergoing field trials with the 9th Domain Battlegroup at the time of the Collapse. It had been on the verge of cancellation due to its unusually high power output and complexity, both of which was seen as excessive by Domain bureaucrats, and may very well have been abandoned entirely had the gate network remained intact.

As it stands, after decades of trial and error, the best technicians of the Fleet have finally reverse engineered the prototypes into a forge compatible template. The first assembled batch has already found its way to the Honor Guard, who have renamed it the Stormlight for the awe inspiring devastation it can unleash.",,,
twin_tactical_laser_ix,WEAPON,"A dependable mid-sized combat laser. Despite its appearance, it is more than simply two smaller Tactical Lasers mounted together. The finely calibrated lens assemblies allow for a much higher combined energy output, leading to a weapon that is more than the sum of its parts.",,,
vampyr_ix,WEAPON,"Based on the technology of the Terminus Relay, the Vampyr generates a high energy gamma ray burst against a tungsten emission source, then channels the resulting positron stream at the intended target. The stream is naturally attracted to a ship's drive field, and imparts tremendous heat and EM radiation upon impact. This complex weapon cannot be accommodated even by a large modular mount. It must be integrated into the hull of a suitable capital ship directly at the forge level.",,,
,,,,,
ix_zorya_piorun,CUSTOM,"Piorun was settled by 9th Domain Battlegroup survivors shortly after their dramatic falling out with the Hegemony. Initially a dry and barely habitable desert world, the surface was bombarded with ice meteorites and seeded with engineered microbes, which combined to rapidly bring the atmosphere towards breathable terran norms. The settlers wasted no time in building their new stronghold into an industrial powerhouse, and have made widespread use of flash imprinted clones who are born loyal to the Fleet.",,"Gleaming towers soar into the sky, bathed in the light of the system's crimson sun. A massive spaceport on the outskirts of the capital directs a steady flow of inner system traffic moving a wealth of refined metals and industrial chemicals off-world, ready to be turned into weapons of war.",
ix_zorya_vertex,CUSTOM,"Seat of the reestablished 9th Domain Battlegroup Fleet Command, and one of the largest space stations ever built, Vertex Station was placed to deliberately maximize thermal exposure to the Zorya star at all times. An exotic quantum computer that violates the laws of thermodynamics sits at the station's heart, performing a staggering amount of strategic calculations that plot the future total victory of Fleet Command.",,"As the gargantuan station looms across your viewscreen, ship sensors begin to pick up a flurry of activity. Automated worker drones dart between hundreds of cargo gantries and docking bays, ferrying supplies and performing maintenance. The Fleet will not rest until every other major polity has been subjugated or destroyed, and so the work continues.",
ix_zorya_rusalka,CUSTOM,"The stormy water world of Rusalka forms a key pillar of the 9th Domain Battlegroup's long term plans to destabilize the Sector. Originally chosen as a site for industrial aquaculture, the unique properties of its ocean biome quickly pivoted the colony towards narcotics production. Massive harvester rigs dredge up entire forests of macroalgae to process into highly addictive psychotropics, which are then sold in bulk to Fleet contacts in the criminal underworld. Those smugglers often go on to make vast fortunes for themselves, while ruining countless lives across the Sector, one euphoric high at a time.",,"The skies of Rusalka are filled with both orderly combat air patrols from the Fleet, and a far more motley group of cargo haulers and pinnaces, often bearing all manner questionable markings. Those who crew the latter know to be on their best behavior at all times. Rusalka's status as a pirate friendly free port has earned it a degree of openness not found anywhere else among the notoriously isolationist IX Battlegroup. However, any misstep from an outsider is likely to draw a quick and decisive response, one that can often end in violence.",
ix_zorya_scorn,CUSTOM,"The planet now known as Scorn serves as an abject reminder of the price of defying the 9th Domain Battlegroup. When the local colonists dared to suggest a negotiated rather than unconditional surrender, the Fleet deliberately bombed its cities with cobalt salted atomics, rendering the surface an irradiated wasteland. Desperate bands of survivors continue to eke out a living in underground shelters and other remote areas, aided by the few free captains who are willing to venture to the surface to trade food and supplies for treasures looted from a dying world.",,"Radiation sensors aboard your ship loudly protest your approach towards the surface. Many of the ruins below were not hit in the initial bombardment of the planet, but were still rendered uninhabitable soon after by radioactive fallout. A local warlord controls what remains of the planet's sole operational starport, acting as the intermediary between survivors in dire need of food and supplies, and free captains keen to exploit their desperation.",
