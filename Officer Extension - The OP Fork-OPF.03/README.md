# Officer Extension - The OP Fork

A Starsector mod that officers additional functionality for managing officers.

This fork of OE adds the ability to increase level cap for individual ~~waifus~~officers using storypoints.

Will probably die out soon as I'm looking for ways to make this a submod of OE rather than a fork. - scratch this, I can't access the private classes with my own subclass, so this will simply not happen.

## List o Credits

Since I'm literally just a copy and paste bot when it comes to modding, this fork is literally a compilation of everyone's work on discord. Credits are in chronological order.

- float for the original mod, of course! [At least that's what they're called on the forum]
- ruddygreat for working out the basics of modding with me.
- Lukas04 for the enlightments into the depths of SS reflections and help on skills.
- AtlanticAccent for working through a ton of stuff with me that I can write a book on probably, also the conversations kept me sane.
- Starficz for the life saving Intelli search hotkeys.
- AERO for recommending me to do a submod instead of a fork.
- Histidine for telling me the idea above is impossible for OR.
- superyuuki for pointing me to some crazy lib that supposedly can make a submod but I don't understand at all so I gave up.
- Sorrydough for showing me the ways of console message debugging.
- and everone who beared with my spamming of the modding channel.

So yeah, thanks a lot guys!
