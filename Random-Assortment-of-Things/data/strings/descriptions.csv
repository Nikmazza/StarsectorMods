#Abyss Logs,,,,,,
rat_abyss_log0,CUSTOM,Abyssal Matter,"There are lots of unique aspects about this environment, but one of the defining factors is the exotic matter that engulfs its entirety. Unlike the vacuum of space, moving through it causes constant drag on the hulls surface, and even though the forces at play are rather weak, the persistance of it increases the maintenance required drasticly.  

Not to mention that our sensory instruments are almost useless, as their signals decay after passing through even just short distances of this stuff. We are essentially flying blindfolded.

I atleast find the sound caused by the ship pushing against the abyssal matter to be rather calming, it is a nice change of pace compared to the silence that is only ever broken up by the sound of parts breaking appart, though we aren’t missing that part here either.

Some crew reports hearing more than just those sounds, but i find it easy to blame it on the paranoia caused by our total isolation.
",,,
rat_abyss_log1,CUSTOM,Mysterious Particles,"Within the abyssal matter theres occasionally small clumps of especially charged mass. We arent quite sure about the process that creates them, but they turn out to be quite useful for us. The sensors can distinguish them from the rest of the environment and track their paths. It helps us analyse the shifting flows and optimise our pathing for the least resistance.

There however appear to be certain zones that have an especially high concentration of those particles, and traversing them has caused atleast a dozen electronic malfunctions for our fleet.

A few crew members seem to enjoy watching this anomaly through the fleets instruments, it apparently reminds them of the weather of their homeworld.
",,,
rat_abyss_log2,CUSTOM,Autonomous Operations,"Overtime the expeditions in to the abyss ramped up. As we discovered more use for the abyssal matter for new technologies, more parties started to show interests despite the danger. 

Due to this new found interest, the place has been flooded with autonomous droneships. Everyone is trying to either make the most of the financial gain connected to taking their own share, and such has been much easier when hulls dont have to be made to a human standard or their families have to be compensated.

Despite this, the AI cores prove rather unreliable at times. At times the droneships have been missing for days after their scheduled arrival date and cores have been found to be rather irresponsive during their flights.

All this commotion even lead to a new gate being constructed close to the surface of the abyss. There were concerns about how it would interact with the enviroment at first, but it appears to be working fine in the end. 
",,,
rat_abyss_log3,CUSTOM,Vastness,"As we first discovered this abyss, we were unable to make it through the terrain and had to wait for further supplies and improved hulls to arrive from beyond the gates. It would be suicide to attempt expeditions without that equipment.

We’ve been traversing it for months now, each time we surface back in to hyperspace and dive back in we make some more progress in to its depths, but we havent been able to discover anything new for a while now.

Despite that, there almost seems to be no end to this place. We have so much to still explain, and im sure we will find the answers somewhere deeper. 
",,,
rat_abyss_log4,CUSTOM,Missed Schedule,"We’ve been reliant on the scheduled arrival of new supplies to keep this station running, but it has been days now and the fleets still havent arrived. We have tried to contact nearby stations for help, but they can only offer the same complaint.

It seriously can’t be so hard to send new supplies through the gates, especially with so much capital at risk, how incompetent and irresponsible can they be up there? If this continues we will have to abandon this station and make way for the upper levels. We have to hope that other stations on the way can spare us supplies for our way back.
",,,
rat_abyss_log5,CUSTOM,Breach,"On more than just one occasion at this point faults in the hull of some poor vessel caused some of the exotic matter to breach in to the ship. So far we have been lucky and all breaches could be repaired before it turned in to the worst case scenario. 

However there was one incident that is stuck in my mind. On one such breach a fellow crewman got exposed to the stuff with direct contact to his skin. Lets just say that it did not turn out well for him. He appeared fine at first, but just a few hours later he started screaming in agony, the medical team could find nothing wrong with his body, but he passed shortly after from the shock.

Whatever that shit is, i dont wanna be anywhere near it. And all of this was just from contact with a brief contact on this fellows skin, i wouldnt want to know how much worse longer exposure would be.
",,,
rat_abyss_log6,CUSTOM,Pressure,"The deeper we descend, the denser the surrounding matter gets. We’ve tried to fly even further, but this density is proving to be to much of a logistical and navigational issue. Even with the recent increase in activity, no reasonable man is foolish enough to make their way through. Almost only drones have been send in to those environments, but proving our theory of the uninhabitibility of those parts, only few make a return.

Of those that do, the cores seem weirdly…scarred. Not much in a physical way, but they have been behaving…odd, to say the least. They have been inspected for damage but nothing of significance has been found.

#Exo,,,,,,
rat_exotech,FACTION,"A megacorporation once known as ""ExoTech Engineering"", a research and construction subsidary of ""Altair Exotech"". Their primary purpose was on logistic efforts in the fringes of yet to be developed sectors. Being much more reliant on hyperspace technologies, much of their budget was invested in to researching technologies for improved non-gate travel. 

Eventually a breakthrough was made with a design that merges a ships flux coils with phase components, opening the door for phase ships that were much more compact and integrated. However the real breakthrough became apparent when this design was incorporated in to creating megastructures called “Exoships”; colossal structures capable of tearing open an entrance to a hyperspace-adjacent space. Traversing this 'exo-space' condenses distances far more than almost any other form of travel, second only to gates. Only a few of them were finished before the collapse.

With the fall of the domain gate system, 'exo-space' travel quickly became the superior method of travel, even if limited by what they could finish before the collapse. Exploiting the power of the Exoship, Exocorp quickly became a disproportionately significant power in the sector. As the situation deteriorated further during the Collapse, and the Gates showing no sign of reopening, the company directors present in the sector and officials of a small Exocorp company outpost in the ""Daybreak"" system, decided to secure their own interests for the following era of chaos.

What was once seen as the future for first-step galactic expansion, was now repurposed for acts of piracy against less fortunate settlements. An isolated colony almost never had a chance in preparing for a sudden raid from an Exoship, and often had to capitulate and surrender assets without a fight. Much of the spoils were repurposed for the expansion and production of High-Tech military fleets, that now patrol the system of their Homeworld. However, rumors abound that almost half of this stolen bounty has been placed for future use in a “Vault”; a system so far removed from the core-worlds that no military force could reach them without their own Exoship, holding many treasures that can no longer be replicated since the loss of the gates.

With the state of the sector stabilizing and other powerful factions crystallizing with tougher defenses, the company has stepped back it's 'aggressive asset extraction' policy, and turned to preserving it's place in the status quo. Its acts of piracy and militaristic attitude have not been forgotten, especially in independent systems, but most factions would rather turn a blind-eye than have a rival suddenly appear in key systems with Exotech assistance.",,,,
rat_exo_plasma_generator,CUSTOM,"A ""primitive"", yet in the sector, astonishing attempt at collecting power from the local blackhole.

rat_exo_arc_planet,CUSTOM,"Once a small outpost for exo-techs research within the persean sector, quickly developed in to its homeplanet after the end of the domain-era cut the company off from real headquarters, and a shift towards self-sustainability caused it to stop adhering to its parent company.",,"A somewhat unique planet in that it had all the necessary ressources to eventually blossom in to a habitateable world, but due to the low heat emissioned from the systems blackhole never could. Not much of terraforming efforts were made by its settlers until the collapse caused their stay to become permanent. 

Extreme efforts were done to construct an array of plasma generators around the blackholes orbit that could send high-energy lasers towards the planet. With the energy gained from this process, terraforming this planet in to a liveable world became a possibility, and so over the last hundreds of cycles a once desolate planet turned in to a terran-adjacent world.",,
rat_exo_daybreak_station,CUSTOM,"An outpost in the daybreak system that began its existance to aid colonisation efforts on ""Arc"".

Much of those efforts were later repurposed to further the companies own goal, rather than their contractors.",,,,
