,,,,,,
ork_dreadnotv2,SHIP,"The largest ship design produced by the Bultach Coalition, the Fregairt-class is best described as a dreadnought of heavy steel and a massive array of weapons. The Coalition's final stake in their struggle to oppose the Tri-Tach Megacorporation, this capital ship is primarily used to hold the line unwavering, even against the most powerful foes such as the Astral or Paragon designs of Corporate fame. 

Carrying a massive amount of armaments as well as a narrow but efficient shield emitter, any fleet spotted with this vessel is rarely trifled with.",,,,
ork_vencha,SHIP,"Inspired by an earlier, modified version of a Venture cruiser, the Ramala-class serves as a battlecarrier for the Coalition Navy, bringing fighters to the front line while keeping a heavy set of armor and weapons on hand in most engagements.",,,,
ork_faster,SHIP,"Trading armor for unmatched speed for its class and armaments, the Ruith-class is excellent at running down weaker ships and giving chase to damaged foes, often able to avoid any ships it cannot take in a direct fight. Quite popular with the more aggressive captains in the Coalition navy, who prefer a speedier alternative to the more common, heavily armored cruisers.",,,,
ork_smasha,SHIP,"A heavily armored, heavily armed destroyer, the Smàladair-class is capable of harassing a wide array of ships, or even forcefully repositioning them. Notorious for it's ability to use it's heavily armored front as a battering ram to disable shields, or to finish off weak ships.",,,,
ork_hammah,SHIP,"A support ship often seen escorting larger Bultach vessels, the Cruinn-class brings a cheap form of a heavy ballistics package to the front line. Capable of delivering much needed blows to armor that would otherwise require whittling down, often with lower grade weaponry.",,,,
ork_grot,SHIP,"Heavily armed and armored for it's class, the Dreach-class is a common frigate design used by Bultach for harrasser roles. Uniquely, the Dreach excels at soaking up damage for vulnerable ships of higher importance.",,,,
ork_bigscrap,SHIP,"The first capital design made by the Bultach Coaltion, the tried and true Daiche-class battlecarrier has seen several iterative upgrade packages over it's lifetime. While somewhat outdated compared to more modern designs fielded by the Persean Sector, the Daiche battlecarrier is a reliable anchor for smaller fleets and has survived over a century of continual combat against vastly superior oppoents in some cases. 

Heavily armored and slow, this Daiche has cemented itself as part of the Bultach Navy's fleet doctrine. Typically the flagship for smaller patrols, it is meant as the anvil to the hammer of it's escorts and packs enough firepower to consistently survive multiple engagements.",,,,
ork_spacehulk,SHIP,"Made of countless smaller hulls and often put together from cannibalized small pirate vessels, but just as often made from the various scrapyards left drifting in the void of space, no two Space Hulk-class vessels are the same. Regardless, each one is fitted with enough weapons to wrestle with stations, fleets and carries a terrifying set of thrusters that let it ram directly into enemy lines. Worse still, even destroying it often leaves the carcass for pirates to reclaim, brought back with a vengeance each time.

The ""zombie"" ship nature of a Space Hulk gives it something of a sinister reputation with captains and spaceport bars. Additionally, these vessels are a logistical nightmare with most repair crews as there is no proper standard when one arrives in a port of call for said repairs.",,,,
ork_interdictor,SHIP,"Made for hunting down phase ships, the Plàigh-class excels at just that role. Plàigh-class ships are equipped with specialized systems that allow the capability of ripping ships out of P-space, but is also able to hold its own against other ships, albeit to a minor degree outside it's intended role.",,,,
ork_prong,SHIP,"Fast, tough and carrying a heavy amount of armaments for it's size, the Fithea-class is a simple ship in construction for it's size. A fairly common destroyer in Bultach Navy service, Fitheas are used as an escort for trade fleets, or to pad out gaps in combat fleets which normally don't carry as much firepower, such as pickets or light patrols.",,,,
ork_bees,SHIP,"A small carrier often seen in minor Bultach patrols, the Snàthad-class brings a moderate level of support to the battlefield, while still being able to hold its own under pressure.",,,,
ork_mining,SHIP,"Originally made in the early years of the Company War, back when the Bultach Coalition was a rather more desperate polity, the Mèinneadh-class is a mining vessel militarized for war. Most Mèinneadhs feature hastily welded armor, which is then put together en-masse to quickly gather much needed resources without the threat of loss to hostiles. Despite this, Mèinneadhs are still seen often enough due to their cheap design.",,,,
ork_old,SHIP,"One of the first ships ever produced natively by the Bultach Coalition, the Roimhe-class is a cheap overhaul of the Mule-class combat freighter, resulting in a surpisingly powerful destroyer, albeit not quite as useful as more expensive ships of it's class. Roimhe-class vessels have gained recent popularity even among Independants, due to their cheap conversion costs and the common nature of the Mule-class to begin with. Thanks to this, they are widely exported, constructed, and often serve many budding mercenary commanders.",,,,
ork_scrimb,SHIP,"A small, exceptionally nimble frigate, the Sgoinneil-class is seen in nearly all Bultach fleet compositions. Capable of harrassing larger ships and dueling with other frigates of similar size and roles.",,,,
ork_bastard,SHIP,"A frigate entirely dedicated to bringing along fighter, and minor missile support, the Madach is found in nearly every Bultach Coalition fleet, hidden behind more heavily armored allies to provide valuable support to any engagement.",,,,
ork_mech,SHIP,"A curious design, the Buail-class is a hard-hitting, well armored ship sporting two, built-in and downsized Thermal Pulse Cannons, which serve as ""arms"". Although these weapons deal far less damage than their larger cousin, they are still quite efficient.

Unfortunately, due to the logistics needed to support them, the Buail lacks a shield generator.",,,,
ork_battlecruiser,SHIP,"In order to avoid being outmaneuvered by the high-tech ship designs used by their Tri Tachyon opponents, the Bultach Coalition often fields a Nadhmòr-class cruiser, usually found in larger war fleets. Poorly armored but just as armed as their main capital ship, the Nadhmòr has incredible maneuverability to compensate for it's more fragile nature.",,,,
ork_tail,SHIP,"One of the newest ships developed by the Bultach Coalition, the Daignich-class carries an impressive flux core which mainly powers its unique ship system. Heavily armored and focused on support, this ship is not to be ignored by most experienced pilots.",,,,
ork_murtach,SHIP,"WIP experimental phase cruiser thing, do not perceive it.",,,,
ork_racer,SHIP,"The newest frigate found in Bultach fleets, the Ghean-class is a nimble ship with a respectable weapons package. It's most powerful feature is it's Flux Booster ship system, which allows it to keep up with targets attempting to flee and keep up offensive operations for much longer periods of time.",,,,
ork_bigracer,SHIP,"Essentially the big brother to the Ghean frigate, the Dhaich-class cruiser is an agile design meant to harass whatever it cannot kill on its own. Often found on the front lines with frigate escorts, more often than not.",,,,
ork_crusher,SHIP,"Covered in hulking armor plates and bristling with forward facing armaments, the Aghaidh-class is capable of truly awesome firepower for its class, as well as being able to withstand withering punishment itself. While slow and lumbering, the Aghaidh is able to use its ship system to crush smaller ships, or launch others away from vulnerable holes in Bultach battle lines.",,,,
ork_skrunkly,SHIP,"A hardy, common frigate found in many Bultach fleets, the Gath-class frigate is simple, tried and true. Though underwhelming in it's PD capabilities, it brings enough strike potential to see much use in just about any fleet found in the Coalition, able to take quite a bit of punishment, for a frigate.",,,,
ork_speeder,SHIP,"A destroyer focused on strike capability and speed above all other, the Luath is capable of accompanying frigates on the frontlines, providing a mini-anchor for a battle's first engagements before larger vessels come into play. Even against larger foes, the Luath-class destroyer can often provide a valuable distraction, or a deadly thorn, if it manages to flank an unsuspecting capital.",,,,
ork_thrasher,SHIP,"Deceptively well-armed and armored for it's size, as a smaller cruiser, the Mòran-class is designed as a relatively cheap way of punching through enemy lines, or using brute force to reposition a ship. Straining even the toughest of shield generators with it's sheer speed, and enhanced mass upon impact-- smaller vessels often being outright destroyed by the wild charge. The Mòran is particularly favored by the aggressive and reckless Captains, due to it's tendency to get in knife-fighting range.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#fighters,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_light_fighter,SHIP,"A simple, useful design found in nearly all Bultach fleets sporting a carrier, the Brònach-class fighter is decently reliable in it's ability to overwhelm smaller wings, as well as lone ships-- though this can often lead to high casualties if a encountering a competent PD grid.",,,,
ork_heavy_fighter,SHIP,"A slower, more expensive fighter, the Seillean-class is less often used due to lengthy replacement times. It makes up for this with a respectable armament, including a downscaled Teth plasma cannon, which it can fire in small bursts to devestate other wings head on, or chew into larger ship's armor.",,,,
ork_bomber,SHIP,"The only bomber fielded by carriers in the Coalition, the Chaneil-class bomber is fairly slow, but carries a heavy payload of two downsized Caillean torpedoes. It is capable of both pressuring shields with each pass, or devestating armor and hull.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#supers,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_superdread_main,SHIP,"The pearl of the Bultach navy, both a powerful morale and propaganda piece often used to strike both fear and awe into those who view it, housing thousands upon thousands of crew, and easily outsizing-- as well as outgunning entire stations. The DòrnDhè is often credited as the will of the Bultach Coalition's citizens, their rage made manifest.

It is to spearhead their assault against Tritachyon's planets, with the capability to reduce the surface of any colony to a sheet of glass solely on it's own. The vengeful spirit of a spiteful populace.

Doubling as a last resort, it presents the option to embark upon it as an ark ship, to carry a large chunk of the population to safe haven, should the Bultach Coalition's war come to that.

",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_redemption_main,SHIP,"One of the legendary sporeships; that which first seeded planets for life in the sector, changed into a grotesque amalgam of Luddic wrath. Able to serve both as a base of operations in and of itself, as well as rain holy justice upon any servants of Moloch in it's path. Where it goes, destruction follows in it's wake. Almost regarded as a myth, with how rare this class of vessel is, but tales of horror are still told in hushed tones by spacers who have supposedly caught sight of these monstrosities. Tales of holy horns blaring, and massive pather fleets following along it's radioactive plume.

Heavily armored from it's sheer size alone, the Redemption can brush off strikes that would prove destructive to many other ships. Using it's sheer weight as a battering ram against any foe unfortunate enough to have drawn it's ire. Capable of going toe to toe with entire battlestations, and reducing them to molten, radioactive slag. The Stars held no anger, only disappointment. Man found themselves lacking in the face of damnation. No heresy could protect them from their punishment. May the holy void have mercy on them.

""Upon this rock, I will build my church.""
""To which even the most depraved servants of moloch may be redeemed.""
""Blessed by his holy void in final absolution.""

",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_sgr_main,SHIP,"The largest ship regularly produced by the Coalition, and quite possibly the sector at large, the Sathar-class dwarfs even the paragon in sheer size and might. Carrying a truly terrifying armament intended on lasting even the most prolonged battles, or laying siege to the most powerful of stations. While extremely powerful, it has an intense logistical overhead, which the Bultach Coalition has deemed acceptable, for it's performance in battle.

When first developed, the Sathar-class Heavy Dreadnought was a boon indeed; providing moving bulwarks against any attempt at invasion into their cherished home system. Since then they have only been further refined and tweaked, and been the ideal ship to bring along for strength presentations, or negotiations with factions that have been deemed too friendly with Tritach; with an urge to reconsider ther relations.",,,,

#pirate/pather,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_bigscrap_path,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

The first capital made by the Bultach Coaltion; hangar bay instead filled with the necessary components to fuel a singular, massive engine-- giving this armored vessel a truly terrifying speed boost. Even more weapon mounts fitted to it's well armored frame, this tried and true vessel is now a nightmare of a patrol officer.

",,,,
ork_mule_mk3,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war.

This simple combat freighter has been overhauled by the Luddic Path. Strapped with as many mounts as it can hold, and fitted with a dangerous amount of engines, it makes a surprisingly formidable, albeit fragile destroyer.",,,,
ork_ramshackle,SHIP,"A twisted amalgam of hullfoam and shoddily welded armor plates, no two Ramschackle-class cruisers are quite the same, coming from different base ships. Nevertheless, they pack a respectable amount of armament, and can take a heavy beating before being ripped apart.",,,,
ork_vencha_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

This Luddic conversion of the Ramala sees it made much faster, it's hangar bay collapsed and welded into additional armor plates, as well as a more weapons haphazardly added to it's frame. Albeit more rare, this Path cruiser is a extremely potent threat.",,,,
ork_hammah_pather,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

Already a heavily armed destroyer for it's class, this Cruinn conversion has been pushed to straining speeds, it's large ballistic mount converted to fit missiles instead, giving it terrifying strike potential.",,,,
ork_skrunkly_lp,SHIP,"Fanatics of the Luddic Path have made this ship their own, stripping out all unnecessary furnishing and transforming it into a haphazard vehicle of holy war. But it's slightly amiss. The more hazardous modifications seem to have been done by more professional hands.

Already a somewhat nimble frigate, this conversion sees the Gath made insanely fast; fitted with an engine nearly too big for it's frame. Giving up one of it's hardpoints in exchange for two composites.",,,,
ork_dangerous,SHIP,"A horrifying display of Luddic Path engineering, the Goblin is little more than two Gremlin-class phase coils welded onto a larger frame, and then subsequently loaded with as many guns as the already stressed vessel can carry. Fast, but fragile, this ship often supports bigger Luddic vessels.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_mining_p,SHIP,"A pirate converted variant of the Mèinneadh, this cruiser sports a large ballistic instead of the hangars that normally house mining drones. Additional armor has been crudely welded on and it is a viable threat in battle - but still quite fragile due to it's base internal structure.

Originally made in the early years of the Company War, back when the Bultach Coalition was a rather more desperate polity, the Mèinneadh-class is a mining vessel militarized for war. Most Mèinneadhs feature hastily welded armor, which is then put together en-masse to quickly gather much needed resources without the threat of loss to hostiles. Despite this, Mèinneadhs are still seen often enough due to their cheap design.",,,,
ork_loota_p,SHIP,"Already a tough, well-armed ship before it's capture and subsequent pirate ""upgrades,"" this Bruth-class cruiser has had it's cargo holds collapsed and welded into crude fighter bays instead, additional armor forced onto the frame, larger weapon mounts hacked on, and the ship system dangerously overriden to allow higher mobility. A formidable cruiser by any right, but rarer than those easier to procure.",,,,
ork_logistics_p,SHIP,"A pirate conversion of the Giùlain; a tough, well armed logistics vessel before any modifications, it does not fall prey to capture-- and subsequent modification by pirates quite nearly as often as it's less defended cousins, but in the instances it does, it becomes a potent threat. 

Bristling with guns and missiles alike, as well as a salvaged ""Jet Burst"" ship system from another unfortunate Bultach vessel, this ship is certainly not to be underestimated. Though often outclassed in one on one fights with a proper capital class ship.",,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#logistics,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_loota,SHIP,"Finding themselves with dangerous trade routes hounded by pirates, Tri Tachyon and other threats alike, the Bultach Coalition uses the Brùth-class freighter as a means to mitigate losses through heavy arms and armament, albeit losing cargo space to add these defensive features. 

Nonetheless, the Brùth remains a proven, hardy and rugged vessel that makes most pirate ambushers think twice before engaging one.",,,,
ork_tanka,SHIP,"A standard tanker for Bultach fleets, the Mèinlùtha-class was created with the same philosophy as the Brùth-class freighter, trading overall capacity for a much better combat capability to fend off Tri-Tach and pirate fleets alike.",,,,
ork_logistics,SHIP,"A combination of both cargo and fuel capacity, the Giùlain-class is seen quite often in heavier trade and exploration fleets, capable of supplying and fueling for extended periods of time, as well as putting up a decent fight itself.",,,,
,,,,,,
#weapons,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_rippa,WEAPON,"A weapon no captain wants to be downrange from, the Trì-fillte Cannon is a staple of Bultach fleets. Putting down tremendous levels consistent firepower, with a flux cost to match. Often used by those who desire a more constant pressure than the Mòrangnè Cannon allows.",,,,
ork_rotary,WEAPON,"A more rare sight among Bultach ships, the Neonach Shredder fires a withering storm of kinetic projectiles to heavily pressure shields. It's range leaves it better suited to faster ships, where it can truly shine.",,,,
ork_dispenser,WEAPON,"A minigun capable of a truly terrifying rate of fire, the Chrìoch truly decimates smaller ships-- but falters against those clad in heavier armor, often requiring the armor to be weakened or destroyed first to prove useful.",,,,
ork_thumpa,WEAPON,"The Slige Autocannon, while quite good at shredding enemy shields with heavy, kinetic slugs, suffers from an inefficient flux use to do so. Despite this, it is a mainstay in Bultach fleets, proving dependable and easy to mount.",,,,
ork_layzah,WEAPON,"Rarely seen due to the low-tech nature of Bultach ships, the Fuadian Lance is a straightforward laser, trading EMP capability for pure damage, it excells at pressuring shields and armor alike.",,,,
ork_shoota,WEAPON,A turret comprised of three tpc turrets crudely ripped from battle wreckage. Losing efficiency in the process of being transformed into this massive turret.,,,,
ork_plasma,WEAPON,"Initially designed to be a railgun for hammering down on shields, the Teth Plasma Cannon instead fired much too fast-- resulting in the shell becoming a hot plasma. Nonetheless, quite effective, but quite expensive to mount.",,,,
ork_dakka,WEAPON,"Integrated into the hull of ork Kroozers and locked on a forward angle, these weapons give their fleet a massive level of standard firepower.",,,,
ork_shotgun,WEAPON,"Essentially a downscaled hellbore, this cannon provides decent punch and armor penetration for it's size, but suffers from a slow reload and projectile speed.",,,,
ork_big_shotgun,WEAPON,"Created from the idea of simply making a bigger hellbore, this cannon launches massive, slow moving shells loaded with a secondary plasma warhead, boosting it's effective use against shields. Ineffective against most small targets or those at great range.",,,,
ork_slug,WEAPON,"A small, efficient burst mortar, the Peilt is found on many Bultach ships as a simple means of dealing with low grade armor.",,,,
ork_tpb,WEAPON,"Built into the Buail, this downscaled TPC is an efficient, albeit ammo-restricted weapon used to deadly effect by the destroyer.",,,,
ork_tpb2,WEAPON,"Built into the Buail, this downscaled TPC is an efficient, albeit ammo-restricted weapon used to deadly effect by the destroyer.",,,,
ork_bigplasma,WEAPON,"Following the success of the Teth Plasma Cannon, the Teotha Plasma Cannon was made. For all purposes a simple upscaling of the weapon, capable of shredding through shields, armor, and hull alike-- but at a heavy mount and flux cost.",,,,
ork_hell,WEAPON,"A large, crude cannon with shells so large it needs to be directly fueled with AM fuel, the ""Hellburn"" is nonetheless a terrifying weapon to face.",,,,
ork_nailer,WEAPON,"In order to work through tougher shields, the Bultach Coalition made a massive autocannon that fires terrifying lead spikes at high speed. Capable of shredding through hull in their own right, given their sheer size and weight.  ",,,,
ork_bolta,WEAPON,"A crude, old weapon still rarely seen among Bultach ships, the Seilch Autocannon slowly fires large kinetic rounds. Short range and subpar accuracy prevent a more prolific use, but it is effective enough when it hits it's intended target. ",,,,
ork_sledge,WEAPON,"Taking inspiration from the commonly used ""Hammer"" torpedoes, the Bultach Coalition set out to make a similar-- albeit more reliable launcher. Sacrificing a bit of payload for more accuracy, ammo and range, Caillean torpedoes can devestate vulnerable targets, as well as strain shield generators with their payload outright.",,,,
ork_sledge_medium,WEAPON,"Taking inspiration from the commonly used ""Hammer"" torpedoes, the Bultach Coalition set out to make a similar-- albeit more reliable launcher. Sacrificing a bit of payload for more accuracy, ammo and range, Caillean torpedoes can devestate vulnerable targets, as well as strain shield generators with their payload outright.",,,,
ork_sledge_small,WEAPON,"Taking inspiration from the commonly used ""Hammer"" torpedoes, the Bultach Coalition set out to make a similar-- albeit more reliable launcher. Sacrificing a bit of payload for more accuracy, ammo and range, Caillean torpedoes can devestate vulnerable targets, as well as strain shield generators with their payload outright.",,,,
ork_plasma_shotgun,WEAPON,"Using an incredibly powerful magnetic rail system, the Loshe heats it's spray of shells into a molten plasma as they exit the barrel of the weapon. Bursting upon impact of any obstacle or enemy. Short range and unpredictable, this weapon is favored by more aggressive captains for it's up-close destructive power, even if expensive to mount.",,,,
ork_plasma_shotgun_medium,WEAPON,"A smaller version of the Loshe, the Losgadh works similarly; heating it's lesser spray of shells into a molten plasma as they exit the barrel of the weapon. Bursting upon impact of any obstacle or enemy. Short range and unpredictable, this weapon is favored by more aggressive captains for it's up-close destructive power, even if expensive to mount.",,,,
ork_rotary_pd,WEAPON,"Cheap and dependable, this rotary PD minigun is a common choice for many Bultach Coalition captains. Albeit more flux inefficient than it's cousins, it still sees common use.",,,,
ork_rotary_pd_small,WEAPON,"Cheap and dependable, this rotary PD minigun is a common choice for many Bultach Coalition captains looking for an alternative to the common vulcan cannon. Much more flux inefficient than it's cousins, it still sees common use due to the flak rounds it fires.",,,,
ork_rotary_pd_large,WEAPON,"Cheap and dependable, this dual rotary PD minigun is a common choice for many Bultach Coalition captains. Firing more rounds, more efficiently and at greater range than the small and medium variants in it's line, it can easily shred missiles and fighters alike.",,,,
ork_sledge_fighter,WEAPON,"A slightly smaller, shorter range variant of the Caillean torpedo designed to be more easily carried and re-armed on the Chaneil-class bomber. Nonetheless, it has fantastic strike potential, capable of tearing holes in even the thickest armor.",,,,
ork_noshield_large,WEAPON,"The Unsgiath-series LRM was purposebuilt for prolonged battles and for use against heavy shielding, fitted with an internal autoloader it can indefinitely fire off missiles, albeit with a large reloading time, once it's initial stock is depleted. It sees common use among many Bultach ships as a reliable way of suppressing shields, but it is not without it's flaws. A slow missile speed means it can often be evaded by smaller ships, and the accuracy of the missile's second stage burst leaves much to be desired.",,,,

#big guns,,,,,,
,,,,,,
giga_rail,WEAPON,"Easily the size of a cruiser, this oversized railgun is capable of forcing frigate-sized shells to near light speed-- and it's devestating power couldn't be clearer. It rends directly through shields, ripping apart hull and armor alike as the projectile violently reacts with other matter. Such force is present that it causes small fusion reactions as it spears through any ship unlucky enough to receive it's ire.",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_holy_flame,WEAPON,"A massive, spinally mounted flamethrower aboard the Luddic Path converted Sporeship. While certainly akin to fire in appearence, the reality is it spews a massive torrent of hot, supercharged antimatter. Reducing most anything into smoldering, radioactive slag within mere moments. Those that survive are often inflicted with long-lasting trauma from the sheer trauma of facing such an inhumane weapon.",,,,
,,,,,,
ork_gigashotgun,WEAPON,"Mounted aboard the Sgriosathar alone, this oversized, hulking shotgun is capable of shredding through even the strongest shields. The kinetic slugs it fires so massive that even weaker armor is torn apart. Intended to be used against exceptionally tough warships, or to siege stations.",,,,
,,,,,,
#shipsystems,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ork_displacer,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Using a set of jury rigged phase teleporters and quite a bit of luck, this system allows for the ship to teleport short distances several times in succession.",,,,
rammingdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"By redirecting power from the shield generators, as well as an onboard damper system, ships with the Ramming Drive are allowed a burst of movement. Often used to ram against enemies, preferably while equipped with increased hull integrity.",,,,
burnerdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A terrifying speed boost and common for many piratized Space-Hulks, the Burner Drive is capable of quickly taking it to the front lines, often crushing it's own allied ships along with enemies in its path if not used carefully.",,,,
zapstrike,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A unique piece of equipment used by the Cruithear-class alone, this system allows it to launch EMP arcs at any ship, including fighters within it's range.",,,,
phase_interdict,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A Bultach-designed system made to deal with worrisome phase ships; this classified piece of hardware forcibly tears them from P-space using poorly understood energy dynamics stolen from captured and deconstructed Tri-Tachyon equipment. Disables a target phase ship for some time, albeit at the cost of generating high flux.",,,,
flux_booster,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A fairly new system developed by the Bultach Coalition, the Flux Booster allows a ship to inject built up flux directly into it's engines, violently expelling it from the ship and allowing a brief boost of speed.",,,,
bt_assault_burn,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Provides a long-lasting boost of speed, as well as improving efficiency of ballistic weapons while active.",,,,
bt_engine_burn,SHIP_SYSTEM,Provides several brief but powerful boosts of speed and maneuverability. ,,,,
bt_holy_charge,SHIP_SYSTEM,"With a blare of holy horns, this reclaimed Sporeship rushes forward at terrifying speeds. Destroying most anything not quick enough to get out of the way.",,,,
bt_yoinker,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Using a series of external projectors on the outside of the hull, the Magnetic Pulse system lashes out with rippling arcs of energy; forcibly dragging enemy vessels into firing range. It's effectiveness drops as the mass of the enemy vessel increases, due to the strain on the reactor.",,,,
bt_offensive_overdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The offensive overdrive is an experimental system, only seeing use on the newest Bultach hulls. It overclocks the ship's reactor at the cost of their shields, allowing increased speed, firing rate, and a resistance to hull damage. It allows for a truly terrifying alpha strike potential, or a hasty retreat. But due to the strain of the system, the ship is overloaded for a short period after use.",,,,
phase_interdict_field,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Seeking an answer to Tritachyon phase fleets, the Coalition deploys ships with a specialized reactor; able to tune into P-space, the ship releases turbulent ""ripples"" into it in a small area around it. Much akin to stormy seas, this makes phasing anywhere near a ship with the system extremely flux intensive.",,,,
bt_forcedphase,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Without a proper understanding to phase, the Coalition has taken to forcing the process instead. In a flux-heavy procedure, a ship dives into P-space by sheer force alone, before violently exiting with a burst of chaotic energy. This side effect has proven quite useful, amplifying alpha strike capabilities.",,,,
bt_aegis,SHIP_SYSTEM,"To enhance the survivability of ships in an aggressive doctrine, the Coalition designed the Aegis shield system; a host ship with a particularly powerful reactor can provide a temporary ""skinshield"" to nearby allies. It can absorb a set amount of damage before dissipating, or will flicker from the ship after a short time.",,,,

#faction,,,,,,
,,,,,,
orks,FACTION,"Formed from a lesser known system in the outer reaches of the Persean Sector, the Bultach Coalition originates from the late Domain Era and was drawn to their home system by way of promised conditions from the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. There, the forerunners of the Coalition and thier people suffered years of genetic testing and other experimentations by Tri-Tachyon's research facilities - many of such projects remain classified, unknown to the general public or at very best, minutely documented. Those outcast by society often disappeared to continue the project and following the Great Collapse, the local Tri-Tachyon governor ceased any efforts to keep their experiments unknown to the general populace, fully imposing martial law upon the citizens of the system.

This proved to be a tactical error, as it was only after decades of suffering that Tri-Tachyon was worn thin enough by the First AI War for the people of Bultach to revolt against their corporate overlords. After a bitter campaign that managed to succesfully drive them from the system and then hastily reinforcing it to withstand any efforts to retake their planet, the Bultach Coalition now strikes at Tri-Tachyon at any given opportunity and fiercely defends their territory. While a somewhat smaller state compared to other power players, their feud with Tri-Tachyon continues to the present in what is largely publicized as the Company War and in recent Cycles, the Coalition have also slowly opened up trade with the other powers of the Persean Sector - mainly those that also find themselves at odds with their hated, former megacorporation oppressors. They are known to be willing to use anything and everything in order to gain an upper hand against the hated corporation, but they keep close enough ties with the Hegemony for their alleged more distasteful, or controversial methods to be denied outright in the public eye.

Since their establishment, they have proven themselves to be an industrial powerhouse, churning out a constant tide of vessels, as well as constantly fortifying their main system. Given their willingness to accept them, as well as any other common spacers, many followers of the luddic faith have flocked to the system due to the promise of safety and stability against their most hated enemy, allowing the Bultach Coalition to expand as fast as it has, and to produce industrial works on the scale it regularly does.","Properly formed now, the Bultach Coalition now strikes at Tri-Tach at any chance they have, and fiercely defend their territory. But over time, they have slowly opened up trade with the other powers of the sector-- Mainly those that also find themselves at odds with the megacorporation.",,,

Quite far from the core worlds, the perfect grounds for Tri Tachyon to perform hidden experiments on the generally unaware populace. Post collapse, any attempts to keep this experimentation hidden were abruptly stopped, with the planet struck with pseudo-martial law. Genetic, biological, and chemical weapons and modifications wracked the population for years, building a boiling resentment in all but the richest inhabitants. When the megacorporation was stretched thin and at it's weakest during the first AI war, a massive revolt was launched from Dhachaigh. Destruction wracked both the streets and the space above for all but a year. In the end, the planet was wrenched from Tri Tachyon's grasp, a raging polity rising to become the Bultach Coalition in time.

For years to come, paranoia was rampant. Anyone loyal, or even sympathetic to the megacorporation was promptly put on trial, and either exiled, or executed. Military recruitment was at a massive high, with so many families seeking stability, allowing the young state to rapidly push outwards in it's home system to establish itself.",,,,
bt_miotail,CUSTOM,"The second planet to be freed from the vile clutches of the Tri Tachyon Corportation, Miotail was a much needed industrial center. Heavy in valuable ores, it was an essential stepping stone for mining, and subsequent ship production. With the majority of the population under the same conditions Dhachnaigh was, their liberation was swift. Once organized, and military leaders placed in power, the moon began a massive output of ships. With more than willing volunteers surging forth to be trained, and lifted up into the stars to claim their home. The moon's industrial might has only increased over time, dotted with massive complexes of refineries and underground cities, provided with a surplus of food from their host planet.",,,,
bt_siphon,CUSTOM,"Constructed shortly after the first AI war, after the Bultach Coalition had gained independance through violent uprising against Tri tachyon, this siphon station provided much needed antimatter fuel to the fledgling state. Both a center of siphoning off volatile gasses from it's host gas giant, as well as production of antimatter fuel. This proved to be a massive boon for the Coalition during the second AI war, when the faction was often cut off from trade due to the Tri tachyon corporation's logistic raiding tactics. ",,,,
bt_meinnearach,CUSTOM,"Though Miotail was a large boon indeed, the Bultach Coalition needed yet more resources to feed into it's churning war machine. Meinnearach; a hot, ore rich planet in their home system was quickly colonized following the foundation of the Bultach Coalition. Often, criminals are sentenced to temporary service upon the world to bolster it's mining capabilities, but only the most depraved are made to permanently stay and provide resources for the faction.",,,,

orbital_station_bultach,CUSTOM,"The pearl of the Bultach navy, both a powerful morale and propaganda piece often used to strike both fear and awe into those who view it, housing thousands upon thousands of crew, and easily outsizing-- as well as outgunning entire stations. The DòrnDhè is often credited as the will of the Bultach Coalition's citizens, their rage made manifest.

It is to spearhead their assault against Tritachyon's planets, with the capability to reduce the surface of any colony to a sheet of glass solely on it's own. The vengeful spirit of a spiteful populace.

Doubling as a last resort, it presents the option to embark upon it as an ark ship, to carry a large chunk of the population to safe haven, should the Bultach Coalition's war come to that.

Of course, it is much too resource-draining and heavy in maintenance requirements for it to embark much at all. For now, it rests in orbit of their homeworld, valiantly defending it from any threats, should they come too near.
