Lightweight Plating,TADA_lightArmor,2,,,"defensive, special","Defenses",5000,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,3,6,10,15,data.hullmods.TADA_lightArmor," Replacing the original armor plating with lightweight alloys increases maneuverability and acceleration by %s percent, and raises the top speed by %s.

 This weaker protection however reduces the armor rating by %s percent. The lack of hull integrated flux management systems reduce the ship's dissipation and capacity by %s percents.

 The ship is however less suited to wistand other types of impacts and take %s percents more damage from Energy and %s percents more from Kinetic weapons.

 Best suited for ships with already strong armor to make it more durable.
