sa_pacemaker,SHIP,"In the cycles since the Collapse, many Hegemony Onslaughts have been irrecoverably lost to catastrophic battle damage. Yet lacking the cold practicality to simply gut them and scrap the hulks, the Hegemony donated many of these shattered ship-carcasses to the Luddic Church, who lacked any mainline capital option. Most of these ended up repurposed into shrines, museums, or pilgrim ships, but a few still had their original flux core and some of the central missile mounts, albeit in abysmal condition. 

Desperation and sacred devotion have joined forces to resurrect this corpse of a ship to serve the will of Ludd: whether as the shield of the faithful, or a vengeful hammer to smite the servants of Moloch. Breaches welded and sealed with blessed bulkheads and their unstable flux cores sanctified with sacred unguents, the Pacemaker limps forth to do battle once more in the name of the holy. Even in death does the Onslaught still serve.",,,
sa_scrapship,SHIP,"What one ship cannot do, another can; one post-collapse engineer thought this was a stupid compromise, and set himself to designing a ship that could do it all. The Scrapship manages it all with flexible loadout options and balanced logistical capacity in all aspects, and does so cheaply with easily sourced and mostly legal parts available at even the most remote of scrapyards. She's no specialist, and there's a better ship for each job, but ol' Scrappy is one of the few who can claim to do them all without costing your soul in credits, and she'll carry on for another two hundred cycles if Moloch doesn't get us all.",,,
sa_trocar,SHIP,"A custom job for a daredevil belt racer who made a winning strategy out of taking second place until the last, fatal second. When that dirty racer failed to throw a high stakes race, his sponsors had him tossed out the airlock and put his radical design to more pragmatic use. Where other belt racers were built to gracefully weave through tight asteroid clusters, the Trocar packs on cruiser-grade thrust and armor to simply plow through any obstacle short of a moon. Coupled with its brutal forward firepower, it fights like a jousting knight, rushing in with wild abandon and blasting out the other side, preferably through the wreckage of its target. The other option is a head-on collision, as the Trocar has only a crude analog nav wheel, per its original owner's eccentric design specs.",,,
sa_splint,SHIP,"The lesser half on an Onslaught's lost arm returned into a terrible life. Notable for it's ballistic complement focused around supporting the still intact TPC assembly and powered by a mixture of civillian and warship sublight drives, the Splint moves like a shade of it's past life, bringing the scythe of the reaper to those that dare see it as easy prey. The primary failing of the Splint-class is it's less than dependable hull integrity and unusually high rates of airlock accidents among those who crew these revenant vessels.",,,
sa_splintXIV,SHIP,"The lesser half on an Onslaught's lost arm returned into a terrible life.

The primary failing of the Splint-class is it's less than dependable hull integrity and unusually high rates of airlock accidents among those who crew these revenant vessels.",,,
sa_elanus,SHIP,"Where the Skua was an exercise in compromise for the agile Falcon hull, the Elanus takes a far more direct approach. The base Skua features high density alloy armor plating and a massive armament overhaul, with the fighter bay replaced by a built-in hybrid mass driver. Combining a Hellbore's high explosive charge with a ferro-tungsten kinetic penetrator into a gauss cannon's accelerator coil, this unusual weapon system gives the Elanus both striking power and versatility, at the expense of speed and defensive armament.",,,
sa_elanus_lg,SHIP,"Modified for operations in the Askonia system under orders from Supreme Executor Philip Andrada, this hull includes integrated solar shielding as well as a peculiar internal cladding provided by an industrial conglomerate out of Sindria itself. That the chief designer, appointed by the Supreme Executor for his many cycles of loyal service, sits on the board of that conglomerate is simply an example of the unity and efficiency of the Sindrian Polity.

Where the Skua was an exercise in compromise for the agile Falcon hull, the Elanus takes a far more direct approach. The base Skua features high density alloy armor plating and a massive armament overhaul, with the fighter bay replaced by a built-in hybrid mass driver. Combining a Hellbore's high explosive charge with a ferro-tungsten kinetic penetrator into a gauss cannon's accelerator coil, this unusual weapon system gives the Elanus both striking power and versatility, at the expense of speed and defensive armament.",,,
sa_skua,SHIP,"Yet another refit of the ubiquitous Falcon, the Skua adds a slightly cramped fighter bay to the Falcon's flexible armament, positioned between its forward arms. Armor plating and safety bulkheads have been displaced to make room for the new autovats and a larger engine array, making the Skua even faster than its parent hull, though somewhat more frail. The addition of a fighter escort only further augments the tactical flexibility of the Falcon, permitting more offensive loadouts without sacrificing point defense.",,,
sa_scalpel,SHIP,"Contrary to popular belief, mining is not clumsy work. Blasters may look impressive, but it is precision mining lasers and drills operated by skillful hands which deftly separate silicate chaff from valuable transplutonic ore. The Scalpel is once such design, intended for operation in exceptionally hazardous environments. Whether through piratical desperation, or a misguided appraisal of this utility ship's sleek lines, the Scalpel has moonlighted as a raiding vessel or an assault recon ship. Thin as a rail and armed to the teeth with heavy energy weapons and a fierce missile complement, the Scalpel harvests ships with the same precision as it once harvested transplutonics.",,,
sa_scalpel_lp,SHIP,"An agressive, if unconventinal refit for pather fleets, this scalpel model has been stripped of it's energy weapon compatability in favor of ballistic technology, and an extensive removal of safeties to the point of system recovery being impossible.",,,
sa_mobster,SHIP,"Overgunned and overfluxed, the mobster turns the toothless Phaeton into a vicious gunboat. Pirate ingenuity shines here with the upgrades to the civilian-grade flux core, no less ill-advised than other, more intentionally suicidal overhauls to these pitiable fuel ships. AM fuel lines have been rerouted through the civilian flux core, resulting in capital-grade flux capacity and capital-grade volatility in the shipboard reactor, as well as a general loss of hull integrity around the flux conduits running through the ship. The cautious captain will pound his target from a safe distance, but a bold (or suicidal) captain can deliver a punishing drive-by salvo.",,,
sa_brace,SHIP,"Orbital stations are destroyed with tragic frequency in the Persean Sector, but unlike ships, their sheer bulk and non-mobile construction makes them profitable only as salvage and scrap. Yet every engineering challenge meets its match, and irrecoverable station debris may be reborn as a Brace: a station support battery welded onto massive scavenged engine arrays and covered in fighter bays, with firepower and a fighter complement to match a Legion, with vastly reduced maintenance costs. However, its inferior flux-core, jury-rigged from arrays of sputtering civilian-grade power generators, means it cannot stand in the line of battle as ruggedly as the respectable Legion. Yet many have ignored the Brace's fearsome frontal missile complement, ending up as more scrap to feed the terrible imaginations of more mad engineers.",,,
sa_cast,SHIP,"A bulky, unwieldly, and generally unappealing High-Tech vessel sourced from the damaged memory banks of a decaying station found drifting through the fringe. Components of an Astral, a Paragon, and various High-Tech stations have been identified amidst its ungainly chassis. Tri Tachyon denied authorship of the ugly design, thus grudgingly permitting it's use in Persean League and various other defense fleets, where it fills a semi unique niche as a High-Tech battlecarrier, capable of standing alongside the Paragon in battle, not unlike a High-Tech Legion. 

Its origins remain mysterious, but some engineers believes it may have started as a highly elaborate practical joke. Given its radical departure from the typical aesthetics of High-Tech vessels and the utilitarian appearance of its internal compartments, as well as the profanely-euphemistic sign names coded into the stencil protocol, it is believed that the Cast is the result of a rivalry between two engineers, one of the ascendant High-Tech school and the other of the neo-Low-Tech school. One can only speculate as to the nature of the bet or the point of the prank, but it seems like the engineers were attempting to ape one another's design principles and produce a mockery of the other school's claim to fame. Where the Cast's mate might be found is a mystery for another scavenger to uncover.",,,
sa_grunder,SHIP,"A shieldless fighter-drone hailing from the same design school as the Talon, intended to pull duty both in vacuum and atmosphere. Agile and fragile, these drones depend on their speed and numbers to overwhelm enemy point defenses and screen friendlies from enemy strike craft. Sturdier still than a Wasp, the Grunder rivals the Talon as a general-purpose fighter vessel. Notably, active fighter drones have been discovered in derelict cargo pods dating back as far as the first AI War.",,,
sa_shilage,SHIP,"A heavy interceptor built as the aerospace superiority complement to the Grunder. Where the Grunder distracts PD and rival fighters, the Shilage delivers the killing blow with a rapid-fire light assault gun and a complement of interception missiles. The Shilage's sturdy construction, balanced flight characteristics and heavy armament make it useful even in combatting frigates - along with rumors of a dedicated hive ship independently manufacturing larger wings of these elegant, but vicious strike fighters.",,,
sa_kilo,SHIP,"Mankind's first weapon was a rock, or so the old histories say. If the Persean Sector goes on the way it has, it may well be our last weapon too. The Kilo is a piratical update to the classic rock, adding engines and either a Flak Cannon or cut down Heavy Machine Gun to an appropriately shaped asteroid. Life support, however, is not included; the larger-than-usual crew rides on the outside in hardsuits.",,,
sa_munin,SHIP,"Once a no-frills high-speed interstellar courier, the Munin has seen a new lease on life as a smuggler's lady and the recon leader's faithful warhorse. In either capacity, the Munin can handily fend off anything that it can't outrun - the list of which is short indeed. This variant retains the LX model's sensor diffusing hull materials and passive anti-scan technology, making it not only swift, but stealthy.",,,
sa_hugin,SHIP,"Once a no-frills high-speed interstellar courier, the Hugin has seen a new lease on life as a smuggler's lady and the pirate captain's swift charger. In either capacity, the Hugin can handily fend off anything that it can't outrun - the list of which is short indeed. This aftermarket variant of the Munin lacks the stealth coating of the original, but features hyper-catalyzed engines, improved armor plating, and a mean missile complement to boot.",,,
sa_staros,WEAPON,"The raison d'etre of the Elanus, the Staros mass driver uses proprietary Intermittent Phase Actuated (IPA) ferrotungsten shells with an AM warhead manufactured from a specialized nanoforge integrated directly into the ammo feed system. The result is a high velocity weapon system of devastating impact potential against armor, though reduced effect against shields.

The warhead's maximum energetic potential is only realized with sufficient realspace matter to react with, as the actual semi-phased shell has limited realspace mass. Experiments to produce a modular version which can be keyed to general-purpose shipboard nanoforges are still underway, but working prototypes are still decades away from completion.",,,
sa_gorget,SHIP,"A surprisingly competent post-collapse Midline destroyer born from a somewhat overambitious project to produce a flexible multirole destroyer for the Kazeron Navarchy. Like most such projects, the design parameters changed continuously throughout development, resulting in a vessel that has neither the firepower of its peers like the Sunder, nor the rugged reliability of a gunship like the Hammerhead. However, it is considerably more adaptable than either of the two and possesses mobility more comparable to that of a heavy frigate, without sacrificing defensive characteristics as in the Sunder; the end result is a midline destroyer that can serve acceptably in any role and support more specialized ships in combat.",,,
sa_candela,SHIP,"It is rare to see pirate scavvers come out on top against [REDACTED] ships, and even less likely that they have the requisite technical savvy to repurpose one for their own uses. This droneship has been brought back from the grave, in body if not in soul; its original AI core stripped out and sold to Ludd knows who, it sports a number of inspired and insipid modifications to render it fit for human use. 

The original maintenance drones have been slaved to various sub-delta manned crew controllers at access points bored into the hull, allowing for manual control of previously automated systems. With a large ballistic mount and most of its original weapon complement now serviced by a top-of-the-line ammo feed and flux capacitance overlock system, the Candela can deliver a blistering hail of frontal firepower.
Nonetheless, the Candela's reputation is divisive amongst its crews; the only pressurized compartments are in the Mudskipper's passenger hold (which leaks) and the rear turret. It is not uncommon for brawls to break out just before an engagement, as anyone not sealed into a turret will have to wear a hardsuit, and potentially have to endure a spacewalk to reach their station over the outer hull, desertion rates are very high...",,,
sa_box,SHIP,"A more professional conversion of the infamous Colossus MkIII, the Lunchbox features military-grade fighter vats salvaged from Hegemony patrols and a dramatically upscaled armament. A large composite mount gives it a sharp retort to cocky patrol leaders that mistake the Lunchbox for just another helpless pirate carrier. Thankfully, the sort of engineering skill required to build such a vessel is fairly scarce amongst pirates. More concerning to senior Hegemony admiralty, there's talk among the junior officers of adopting this conversion package for auxiliary service.",,,
overdrive,SHIP_SYSTEM,An overclocked AAF combined with a hacked fighter autofab and a delta AI flux compressor provides bursts of unsurpassed rate of fire to all non-missile weapons at the cost of halved flux reduction compared to similar systems operating within standard parameters.,,,
joust,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A burn drive with a little extra kick in the AM mix, designed for extreme bursts of instant speed, perfect for belt racers and ancient naval military history enthusiasts alike.",,,
temporalshell_degraded,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Speeds up the flow of time on board the ship. Generates a significant amount of flux when used, a lack of maintenance results in longer recharges and shortened active times.

Research on prolonged exposure to the effect was described as 'worrying' and quietly halted.",,,
sa_eclipse,SHIP,"This unholy abomination is a pirate warlord's dark fantasy - a [REDACTED] capital reborn with unflinching vengance. Even with it's original systems in shambles and it's frontal energy hardpoints scrapped for fighter bays, its terror hasn't lessened. Infact something of it's old master remains within this deathless hulk - the malice of an unfeeling, inhuman mind gleaming in the lance tips of it's bristling weaponry.

sa_loki,WEAPON,"A direct downscale of the Mjolnir. Loki is more efficient on energy, but packs a lighter punch and slower fire rate, but still provides a versatile way to pressure enemy ships.",,,
sa_gangster,SHIP,"The little brother of Mobster, the Gangster is a ship that acts tough and intimidating, but in actuality is very much like the modified mudskippers in common use by pirates, filled with excessive numbers of missile mounts and a fuel tank used as the holster for a mid weight ballistic weapon. These modifications were augmented by the inclusion of a marginally better top speed and shield sourced from easily destroyed [Redacted] droneships alongside a pair of active flare launchers being wedged into the hull, turning this once defenseless tanker into a short lived but dangerous missile platform.",,,
sa_earthshaker,WEAPON,"An immense siege cannon normally built into the vast gap of the Gaia, the Earthshaker is a gargantuan twin barrel mining cannon built out of a pair of sublight engine thrusters. The expansive weapon system is primarily utilized as a bombardment tool on particularly dense asteroid clusters or planetary locations. Whispers have been heard in bars of the titanic weapon being built onto a station, usually passed off with laughter and another round of drinks.",,,
sa_gaia,SHIP,"A hand-welded mining super barge designed to strip-mine entire sections of planets singlehandedly under the most hostile of environmental conditions since before the Domain. The central Earthshaker cannon, easily capable of cratering mountain ranges with a volley of asteroid strikes, is more than capable of doing the same to hostile ships when required.

Though the Gaia’s blueprints were once pristine examples of industrial precision, the years of decay since the Collapse have seen the decay of most of the subsystems and modular components, requiring manual construction to finish out the basic design specs with such frivolities as life support and flux infrastructure.",,,
sa_lobster,SHIP,"The pride of Sindria, a heavily armed and armored battlecruiser with better short and mid-range performance than the Conquest, but more modernized armaments than the Onslaught, while also providing its crew (and the local volume) with ample servings of delicious Volturnian lobster (consult Quartermastery before supplementing naval issue protein rations with lobster. Lobster is a privilege, not a right.)


Though representing the Sindria nation’s first truly novel contribution to ship design, the whole project was nearly sunk by critics in the admiralty, with comments like, “for the cost of one Ebirah, we could have seven Eagles!” or “By the Lion and Sun, why in Ludd’s name do we need a flying lobster farm?” and “why is the captain’s chair an aquarium?” 
Yet those myopic fools with their petty insults were silenced by the wise voice of the Lion himself, Supreme Executor Andrada, whose generous support made possible this triumph of Askonian engineering and Volturnian biotechnology. Truly, the few other spacefarms available fail to compete with the Ebirah’s ingenious cocktail of speed, strength, and seafood.",,,
sa_twilight,SHIP,"A disturbingly competent pirate salvage job of a Brilliant class drone cruiser, the Twilight offers a rarely matched package of firepower, protection, and speed to the lucky space dog who can capture one and find a capable engineer to restore it. The modified fighter bay results in more than droneships being safe to load within the frame, and the extra medium ballistic mounting point is both a result of the pirates addiction of additional firepower, and as a clumsy section for crew quarters.

Those who crew these dread ships are of a strange sort, even for pirates; 1s and 0s cover the bulkheads in sinuous binary poetry, recited by hollow-eyed crewmen as they rush to their posts. The engineers are the worst of them - they can be heard in the engine room making ritualistic supplications to unknown gods in languages more reminiscent of binary  or the crackles of machinery than human speech, alongside an obsession with mechanical augments, claiming that flesh fails in their maintenance roles.",,,
sa_erbe,WEAPON,"The origins of the Erbe launcher are unclear, but most evidence points to aftermarket modifications from underworld groups as it's birthplace. The Erbe's ""Missiles"" have been noted as being little more than a grunder interceptor stripped of plating and it's weapon, replaced in favor with a hammer torpedo and tracking equipment to make shoddy but threatening long range armor busters. 

Material banks embedded in the frame of the launch rail assembly allow for reconstruction of the haphazard missiles, but only in limited numbers, and a requirement of manual replacements.",,,
sa_almas,SHIP,"A horrid matrimony of low-tech reliability and high-tech performance existing in the sleek lines of the Almas. A rebuilt matrix-array of plasma thrusters harvested from Shrikes and hardened shield generators, alongside less than legal component sources ending in a startling mixture of raw firepower and rugged durability being combined with the agility of a far lighter craft.",,,
sa_kyresh,SHIP,"During the years before the collapse the Kyresh was primarily used among local planetary security groups as a swift moving patrol craft primarily to catch or track smuggler groups and other small crime groups, but after the collapse many of the blueprints have been modified to remove the holding cell and contraband bay to instead carry a single heavier cannon or missiles, either to chase down smaller ships, or harass larger, better armed targets.",,,
sa_shoggoth,SHIP,"To the Hegemony, this ship does not officially exist, But despite the Hegemony's insistence and efforts, these ships still exist, but the few that have been produced by pirates mad enough to delve into the forbidden systems, reclaiming and harvesting components of the dangers within to forge their own war machines, replacing flimsy scaffolding with broad armor plates, wasted space into large cargo holds, and a stronger generator to give it's bristling guns, energy and ballistic alike, a surge of power to wither down threats that dare attack unprepared.



These hulks bear a strange connection to the Almas and other officially false hulls of pirate invention, though this hulk bears the same binaric poetry of the Twilight, however, the Shoggoth's deranged and augmented crews tend to put particular faith in the certainty of steel, the cleansings of silicon, and the freedom of circuitry. Scholars often question the meanings, but many pass it off as the writings of a drug induced frenzy, while others doubt such statements, believing it to be something more.",,,
sa_durand,SHIP,"Originally designed as a ground based security mech, Durand units have seen modification for warfare in the void of space through weapon clamps on modular arm weaponry, and a clumsy but durable thruster suite, the mechs are often favored by orbital station crews as a solid line of defense, external or internal, much to the chagrin of various syndicates.",,,
sa_durand_head,WEAPON,"A compact emitter array situated within the Durand's sensor array, capable of intercepting missiles and fast moving craft, but strains against most defensive systems and prolonged usage.",,,
sa_durand_frag,WEAPON,"A rapid fire autocannon locked into place on a Durand Chassis, loaded with fragmentation based ammunition the cannon can tear into unarmored targets, but is anemic in damage to shields and thick armor plating.",,,
sa_durand_kinetic,WEAPON,"A rapid fire autocannon locked into place on a Durand Chassis, loaded with kinetic based ammunition, the cannon is effective in straining shield generators, but is inadequate in dealing efficient damage to armor platings.",,,
sa_perigee,SHIP,"A less popular hull design built after the noted success of the Apogee hulls, the Perigee was designed as a companion ""sister ship"" intended to support the Apogee in exploration details. Supplementing it's successor's enhanced sensor array with an onboard suite of surveying equipment and twin hangar bays. The design largely fell out of popularity against the cheaper Venture class hulls, however some fleets do still find certain aspects of these hulls to be useful.",,,
sa_manticore_remnant,SHIP,"A humble Manticore defiled by the servants of Moloch, traced back to the early days of the First AI war, these modified destroyers saw the ammo feeders of the main large turret replaced with missile racks and fabricators, the ballistic rangefinders were deemed a waste and replaced by a complex navigation array, alongside the conversion of it's smaller missile slots into hybrid weapon mounts to make up for the lost firepower in the primary slot.

sa_eradicator_remnant,SHIP,"With general upgrades to thruster output and power infrastructure, this retrofitted Eradicator can bring to bear terrifying close-range energy firepower and the same infamous missile complement as its parent hull, while retaining the potential for ample kinetic or explosive support from a pair of medium ballistic emplacements. Initial AARs from encounters with these new Remnant assault cruisers highlight their capacity to almost instantly cripple much larger vessels with an overcharged energy barrage, then finish them with point-blank torpedo salvoes.

sa_dominator_remnant,SHIP,"At first glance, this state-of-the-art energy refit of the venerable Dominator would seem almost unimaginative: improved engines, hardened shields, and a plasma-jet injector augment the Dominator’s capabilities while changing little about its role. A careful inspection, however, yields an appreciation of subtlety that the Dominator’s original human architects sorely lacked. Medium mounts were removed and the space reused to overhaul the large hardpoints into turrets, allowing its primary battery to cover large, overlapping fields of fire at the cost of weaker point defense and armor, which is compensated for with the reinforced shields.

sa_legion_remnant,SHIP,"The culmination of cycles of experimentation and doctrinal shifts, antiquated low tech engines and weapon mounts replaced by cutting edge energy weaponry and refined engine arrays, the long since obsolete bridge entirely removed, replaced by a missile mounting site, and additional weapon batteries directly installed into the ships's bow, alongide twin rearward defensive sites to lessen a crippling weakness of the original, a truely heretical monstrosity deserving of it's purge by fire.

sa_ageis,SHIP,"A veritable monstrosity of a capital ship, the Aegis is little more than an Onslaught with the hulk of a Guardian grafted to the frame where it's arms used to exist. Where the derelict was found, and how the beast was slain remain a mystery, what isn't a mystery is the wealth of forward firepower and flux reserves the abominaton brings to bear in an engagement. Records, wanted profiles, and the whispers of bar rumors all point to it being the only of it's kind, yet... If this one hull was created, how many other resurrected hulks remain in deep space, waiting to strike?",,,
sa_cricket,SHIP,"Born from mothballs, solder, and unfilled blueprint slots, the Cricket is little more than a crew capsule strung between twin gun pods riding a set of reclaimed thrusters.

Little more than a nuisance alone, Crickets deployed en masse have been noted to drown better armed foes in a torrent of lead- alebit with similarly heroic casualties.",,,
sa_penumbra,SHIP,"Without access to high quality fighter LPCs or decent energy weapons, few pirate lords would be inclined to add a Scintilla to their ragtag fleets. Clever engineers know that hangar forges are easily hacked to produce missiles and landing craft, and so the Penumbra was born as the bane of backwater militias the sector over: capable of supporting attacks on hardened targets with heavy missile fire accompanied by a single fighter wing supported with the original Recall Device, hacked to support marine drop-ships on ground assault duties.",,,
sa_cyclops,SHIP,"The humble Venture is the backbone of fringe exploration efforts, the rugged bulwark and jack of all trades of every serious prospector. The Polyphemus is at first glance only a superficial upgrade, with a reinforced armored prow, a military grade mount for heavy energy or missile weapons, and the drone forgevat hacked to field a pair of what can only be described as “flying mining blasters.” The truth is far more disconcerting; beyond mil-spec shield tuning and redlined flux infrastructure, the Polyphemus boasts a “delta cluster nexus” connected directly to the bridge and essential facilities, reducing crew requirements and extending peak performance time under stress. Tri-Tachyon denies any authorship of this vaguely-legal AI core design; Hegemony attempts to inspect and verify the nexus dome have dug up nothing but scrap, as Polyphemus crews have fought to the death or scuttled their ships rather than allow inspection.",,,

sa_hypermatter,WEAPON,"An anomalously energetic energy crystal utilized as the focal unit of a combat emitter. While standard installation procedures are incredibly simple, the safety procedures to maintain crystal integrity are borderline eldritch in nature, but are absolute necessities to fuel the awe inspiring discharges, ruinous to armor, but almost entirely nullified against energy shielding.

Discovered in a long lost station orbiting a volcanic and gas giant, the origins of the hyper-energetic crystals are subject to intense debates within the Galatian academy. Grudgingly referred to as ""Hypermatter Crystals"", the exotic crystalline structures must be contained within magnetic levitation systems, after an incident during a cargo transport it was learned that any physical contact with the crystals leaves behind only ""dust"" in the aftermath of a highly radioactive discharge.",,,
sa_radcannon,WEAPON,"A weapon used by the fanatical or the insane, this crude weapon utilizes igniting stores of Infernium to generate intense radioactive energies magnetically shaped to inflict crippling damage on the crews and electrical systems of targeted ships, but is effortlessly dissipated by intact armor belts and energy shields. Shared components in energy and ballistic based weapon mountings allow the Ejector to be fitted into both.

Scorned and feared by the more organized polities, the Infernium Ejector is nothing short of barbaric and an affront to any form of humane warfare, ships struck by it have registered hazardously contaminated cycles later, geiger systems even nearing the site of such guns rattle off an electronic protest past the supposed ""shielding"" keeping the crews mostly protected.",,,
sa_pillbox,SHIP,"An odd hulk of a ship, the Pillbox is seemingly a ""restored"" Colossus Mk.II, with a number of explorarium drone-ship components bolted and welded into the hull's frame. While the durability of such upgrades are middling at best, the ship has become an unwieldy, off balance gunboat only seen in extremely limited numbers. Nevertheless these cruisers display an unnervingly active flux grid,, and enough missiles to put even the pd grids of a Low Tech battlegroup on edge, at least until the poor shielding of the Pillbox is challenged.",,,
sa_gloaming,SHIP,"A fairly unusual pirate modification, the Gloam forgoes the additional weapon emplacements many of these lawless ""upgrades"" carry. Instead it utilizes an extremely cramped ""microbay"" hardcoded to deploy exclusively Grunder class drone wings, about as frail as the very drones it deploys, Gloams are notably uneceptional on their own, but can rapidly prove to become a nuisance when other hulls are nearby to draw fire away.

sa_murk,SHIP,"An unsurprising product of pirate bands either brave or suicidal enough to delve into restricted stellar systems, calling the Murk anything beyond a bizarrely shaped wolf would be an insult even to the vessel of Moloch the once frigate has been grafted into. Tracking of these hulls, and their confiscation or destruction, is a frequent activity for low level COMSEC operatives with nothing better to do.",,,
sa_ingot,SHIP,"The Ingot-class Carrier is often mistaken for a Low Tech hull in midline paint due to it's simple, straightforward design. Featuring spacious hanger bays and the ability to rapily produce a reserve of fighters to swiftly deliver a killing with it's amassed strikecraft, or thwart the offensive assault from smaller ships reckless enough to stray from their ranks. Unfortunately this simple design has resulted in a similarly uncomplicated, and almost token weapons array, further complicated by a complete lack of rearward defenses.

A hull of experimental design by Orion Shipyards, the Ingot was developed with smaller patrols and often undersupplied fringe militant forces in mind. As a result of this experimental design, the hull is easily constructed and maintained, with a focus on standardized components and above average power projections for a ship of it's size. Unfortunately despite being a ship with a focus on economy, the Ingot was often almost unfairly pitted against the Heron, with the rival hull class often finding superior favor and production order slots. As a result the Ingot was largely unused by mainline Domain Battlegroups, but found a reserved appreciation among fringe battle commanders and patrol forces with a lack of easy access to resources.",,,
sa_aberration,SHIP,"An anomaly in every sense of the word, while the base of the hull and blueprints match that of a Cerberus, it has a number of clearly autoforged components belonging to unknown origins. Most strikingly among the modifications is a mostly intact Temporal Shell generator assembly plated in some of the only armor found across the entire ship. Fragile, mobile, and capable of taking a bit out of the unwary.",,,
sa_mono_mg,WEAPON,"Little more than a Heavy Machine gun with a feeder and barrel assembly cut away and replaced with rotary servos and stabilizers, while resulting in still being inferior to the original in fire capacity. The result is often jokingly referred to as ""The Medium Machine Gun"".",,,
sa_pangolin,SHIP,"The Pangolin was found in a corrupted archive of low-tech designs from the ascendancy of the Cruiser School. While most of the designs were unintelligible, the Pangolin remained relatively intact; showing promise as a potential replacement to the Legion, prototypes were commissioned. The first prototypes revealed an ambitious marriage of big guns, refined fighter command systems, and at the time, best in class power systems centered around something fairly unusual, an entirely modular energy weapon socket. Daunting forward firepower, backed by a respectable fighter complement and speed to match a Conquest, making  the Pangolin nothing if not versatile, though it pays for this flexibility with poor armor, massive crew requirements, and a less than desireable fuel economy.",,,
sa_ocypote,SHIP,"Belt race jockeys fiercely debate the origins of this sleek and deadly craft, born of a frightfully augmented Kite merged with [REDACTED] shield tech, the hottest engines this side of Hybrasil, and a luxurious command console supported by a host of delta cores. Whether the product of an unhinged speedster or the vanity piece of a bored Culann exec, none can argue with the Ocypote’s impressive speed and survivability with its imposing shield and respectable armament.",,,
sa_cavern,SHIP,"A ship once scorned for it's compromising of combat principles, now viewed as an almost suitable missile and weapons platform for saturated fire. The Cavern is a mockery of the corporate droneship its hull is derived from, terminator drone autofabs torn away in place of much more compact borer drone forges, freeing space for excess cargo to be stored, the AI domes are notably repurposed into the mounting sockets for ballistic armaments, alongside bridge and crew hab modules layered with as much radiation shielding as would fit without hampering combat operations.",,,
